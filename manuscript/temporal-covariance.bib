  title    = "Polygenic adaptation to an environmental shift: temporal dynamics
              of variation under Gaussian stabilizing selection and additive
              effects on a single trait",
  author   = "Thornton, Kevin R",
  abstract = "Predictions about the effect of natural selection on patterns of
              linked neutral variation are largely based on models involving
              the rapid fixation of unconditionally-beneficial mutations.
              However, polygenic traits are expected to evolve by small allele
              frequency changes at many loci. Here, I use explicit forward
              simulations of a single trait with additive-effect mutations
              adapting to an optimum shift. In this model, sweeps of
              large-effect mutations occur from a nearly equal number of new
              mutations and standing variants, except when the trait is highly
              polygenic and fixations from standing variation dominate.
              Large-effect mutations contribute to adaptation even when the
              trait is not mutation-limited. However, such mutations do not
              sweep to fixation on the time scale of adaptation for polygenic
              traits. The signature of hitch-hiking, measured using standard
              summaries of linked variation, are approximately identical for
              the two classes of sweeps, which is due to the equilibrium
              frequencies of standing variants at mutation-selection
              equilibrium at the time of the environmental shift. I also show
              that the mean times to adaptation and patterns of linked
              selection are robust to certain details of the distribution of
              effect sizes, and that the proportion of new mutations of large
              effect is a critical parameter affecting patterns of linked
              selection.",

               sometimes surf on the wave of advance of a population range

               have provided the first experimental evidence of surfing during
               spatial expansions. They also show that the newly colonized area
               should become structured into sectors of low genetic diversity
               separated by sharp allele frequency gradients, increasing the
               global genetic differentiation of the population. These
               experimental results can be easily reproduced in silico and they

              trait-specifically. We identified thousands of quantitative trait
              loci (QTLs) influencing transcript abundance traits in a cross of

  author   = "Crouch, Daniel J M",
  abstract = "The prevalence of sexual reproduction remains mysterious, as it
              poses clear evolutionary drawbacks compared to reproducing
              asexually. Several possible explanations exist, with one of the
              most likely being that finite population size causes linkage
              disequilibria to randomly generate and impede the progress of
              natural selection, and that these are eroded by recombination via
              sexual reproduction. Previous investigations have either analysed
              this phenomenon in detail for small numbers of loci, or performed
              population simulations for many loci. Here we present a
              quantitative genetic model for fitness, based on the Price
              Equation, in order to examine the theoretical consequences of
              randomly generated linkage disequilibria when there are many
              loci. In addition, most previous work has been concerned with the
              long-term consequences of deleterious linkage disequilibria for
              population fitness. The expected change in mean fitness between
              consecutive generations, a measure of short-term evolutionary
              success, is shown under random environmental influences to be
              related to the autocovariance in mean fitness between the
              generations, capturing the effects of stochastic forces such as
              genetic drift. Interaction between genetic drift and natural
              selection, due to randomly generated linkage disequilibria, is
              demonstrated to be one possible source of mean fitness
              autocovariance. This suggests a possible role for sexual
              reproduction in reducing the negative effects of genetic drift,
              thereby improving the short-term efficacy of natural selection.",

  author   = "Hallatschek, Oskar and Nelson, David R",
  abstract = "Large scale genomic surveys are partly motivated by the idea that
              the neutral genetic variation of a population may be used to
              reconstruct its migration history. However, our ability to trace
              back the colonization pathways of a species from their genetic
              footprints is limited by our understanding of the genetic
              consequences of a range expansion. Here, we study, by means of
              simulations and analytical methods, the neutral dynamics of gene
              frequencies in an asexual population undergoing a continual range
              expansion in one dimension. During such a colonization period,
              lineages can fix at the wave front by means of a ``surfing''
              mechanism [Edmonds, C.A., Lillie, A.S., Cavalli-Sforza, L.L.,
              2004. Mutations arising in the wave front of an expanding
              population. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 101, 975-979]. We quantify
              this phenomenon in terms of (i) the spatial distribution of
              lineages that reach fixation and, closely related, (ii) the
              continual loss of genetic diversity (heterozygosity) at the wave
              front, characterizing the approach to fixation. Our stochastic
              simulations show that an effective population size can be
              assigned to the wave that controls the (observable) gradient in
              heterozygosity left behind the colonization process. This
              effective population size is markedly higher in the presence of
              cooperation between individuals (``pushed waves'') than when
              individuals proliferate independently (``pulled waves''), and
              increases only sub-linearly with deme size. To explain these and
              other findings, we develop a versatile analytical approach, based
              on the physics of reaction-diffusion systems, that yields simple
              predictions for any deterministic population dynamics. Our
              analytical theory compares well with the simulation results for
              pushed waves, but is less accurate in the case of pulled waves
              when stochastic fluctuations in the tip of the wave are
              important.",

  abstract = "A trait must genetically correlate with fitness in order to
              evolve in response to natural selection, but theory suggests that
              strong directional selection should erode additive genetic
              variance in fitness and limit future evolutionary potential.
              Balancing selection has been proposed as a mechanism that could
              maintain genetic variance if fitness components trade off with
              one another and has been invoked to account for empirical
              observations of higher levels of additive genetic variance in
              fitness components than would be expected from mutation-selection
              balance. Here, we used a long-term study of an individually
              marked population of North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus
              hudsonicus) to look for evidence of (1) additive genetic variance
              in lifetime reproductive success and (2) fitness trade-offs
              between fitness components, such as male and female fitness or
              fitness in high- and low-resource environments. ``Animal model''
              analyses of a multigenerational pedigree revealed modest maternal
              effects on fitness, but very low levels of additive genetic
              variance in lifetime reproductive success overall as well as
              fitness measures within each sex and environment. It therefore
              appears that there are very low levels of direct genetic variance

              thaliana, we examined whether a standard neutral model of

              Rapidly changing population demographics complicate this

               Prediction of rates of adaptation, in the sense of change in

               expectations for persistence of populations, especially in our
               era of rapid environmental change. Heavy investment in genomics
               and other molecular tools has fueled belief that those
               approaches can effectively predict adaptation into the future. I
               contest this view. Genome scans display the genomic footprints
               of the effects of natural selection and the other evolutionary
               processes over past generations, but it remains problematic to

  abstract = "Different regions of the Drosophila genome have very different
              rates of recombination. For example, near centromeres and near
              the tips of chromosomes, the rates of recombination are much
              lower than in other regions. Several surveys of polymorphisms in
              Drosophila have now documented that levels of DNA polymorphism
              are positively correlated with rates of recombination; i.e.,
              regions with low rates of recombination tend to have low levels
              of DNA polymorphism within populations of Drosophila. Three
              hypotheses are reviewed that might account for these
              observations. The first hypothesis is that regions of low
              recombination have low neutral mutation rates. Under this
              hypothesis between-species divergences should also be low in
              regions of low recombination. In fact, regions of low
              recombination have diverged at the same rate as other regions of
              the genome. On this basis, this strictly neutral hypothesis is
              rejected. The second hypothesis is that the process of fixation
              of favorable mutations leads to the observed correlation between
              polymorphism and recombination. This occurs via genetic
              hitchhiking, in which linked regions of the genome are swept
              along with the selectively favored mutant as it increases in
              frequency and eventually fixes in the population. This
              hitchhiking model with fixation of favorable mutations is
              compatible with major features of the data. By assuming this
              model is correct, one can estimate the rate of fixation of
              favorable mutations. The third hypothesis is that selection
              against continually arising deleterious mutations results in
              reduced levels of polymorphism at linked loci. Analysis of this
              background selection model shows that it can produce some
              reduction in levels of polymorphism but cannot explain some
              extreme cases that have been observed. Thus, it appears that
              hitchhiking of favorable mutations and background selection
              against deleterious mutations must be considered together to
              correctly account for the patterns of polymorphism that are

              focus on selection at linked sites also predict greater
              differentiation in regions of low recombination simply as a
              result of faster sorting of ancestral alleles even in the absence

              flow from patterns of genetic variation is tricky, because both
              ancestral polymorphism and migration lead to shared variation
              between recently diverged taxa. New analytic methods have been

              one-locus two-allele model with recurrent mutation, for which we
              derive accurate analytical approximations for (i) the time at
              which a previously deleterious allele becomes beneficial, (ii)
              the waiting time for a successful new mutation, and (iii) the

              these results, we show that the shortest total time to fixation
              is for alleles with intermediate phenotypic effect. We derive an
              approximation for this ``optimal'' effect, and we show that it
              depends in a simple way on a composite parameter, which
              integrates the ecological parameters and the genetic architecture

              Specifically, we consider the evolution of a polygenic trait that
              is under stabilizing selection with a moving optimum. The
              ecological dynamics are defined by the strength of selection,
              sigma, and the speed of the optimum, v; the key genetic
              parameters are the mutation rate Theta and the variance of the
              effects of new mutations, omega. We develop analytical
              approximations within an ``adaptive-walk'' framework and describe
              how selection acts as a sieve that transforms a given
              distribution of new mutations into the distribution of adaptive
              substitutions. Our analytical results are complemented by

              the adaptive process is mutation limited and dominated by genetic
              constraints, whereas for small gamma it is environmentally

              change per million years) and 2151 evolutionary rates in haldanes
              (standard deviations per generation). Here we demonstrate how
              quantitative rate measures can provide general insights into
              patterns and processes of evolution. The frequency distribution
              of evolutionary rates was approximately log-normal, with many
              slow rates and few fast rates. Net selection intensities
              estimated from haldanes were on average lower than selection
              intensities commonly measured directly in natural populations.
              This difference suggests that natural selection could easily
              accomplish observed microevolution but that the intensities of
              selection typically measured in nature are rarely maintained for
              long (otherwise observed evolutionary rates would be higher).
              Traits closely associated with fitness (life history traits)
              appear to evolve at least as fast as traits less closely tied to
              fitness (morphology). The magnitude of evolutionary difference
              increased with the length of the time interval, particularly when
              maximum rates from a given study were considered. This pattern
              suggests a general underlying tendency toward increasing
              evolutionary diversification with time. However, evolutionary
              rates also tended to decrease with time, perhaps because longer
              time intervals average increasingly disparate rates over time, or
              because evolution slows when populations approach new optima or

              through microevolution occasionally 'writ large' but are perhaps
              temporally characterized by microevolution 'writ in fits and

              have the potential to impact the outcome of ecological
              interactions while they are underway. Observations of this type
              go against accepted wisdom that ecological and evolutionary
              dynamics occur at very different time scales. While some authors
              have evaluated the rapidity of a measured evolutionary rate by
              comparing it to the overall distribution of measured evolutionary
              rates, we believe that ecologists are mainly interested in rapid
              evolution because of its potential to impinge on ecological
              processes. We therefore propose that rapid evolution be defined
              as a genetic change occurring rapidly enough to have a measurable
              impact on simultaneous ecological change. Using this definition
              we propose a framework for decomposing rates of ecological change
              into components driven by simultaneous evolutionary change and by
              change in a non-evolutionary factor (e.g. density dependent
              population dynamics, abiotic environmental change). Evolution is
              judged to be rapid in this ecological context if its contribution
              to ecological change is large relative to the contribution of
              other factors. We provide a worked example of this approach based
              on a theoretical predator?prey interaction [Abrams, P. \&
              Matsuda, H. (1997). Evolution, 51, 1740], and find that in this
              system the impact of prey evolution on predator per capita growth
              rate is 63\% that of internal ecological dynamics. We then
              propose analytical methods for measuring these contributions in
              field situations, and apply them to two long-term data sets for
              which suitable ecological and evolutionary data exist. For both
              data sets relatively high rates of evolutionary change have been
              found when measured as character change in standard deviations
              per generation (haldanes). For Darwin's finches evolving in
              response to fluctuating rainfall [Grant, P.R. \& Grant, B.R.
              (2002). Science, 296, 707], we estimate that evolutionary change
              has been more rapid than ecological change by a factor of 2.2.
              For a population of freshwater copepods whose life history
              evolves in response to fluctuating fish predation [Hairston, N.G.
              Jr \& Dillon, T.A. (1990). Evolution, 44, 1796], we find that
              evolutionary change has been about one quarter the rate of
              ecological change ? less than in the finch example, but
              nevertheless substantial. These analyses support the view that in
              order to understand temporal dynamics in ecological processes it
              is critical to consider the extent to which the attributes of the
              system under investigation are simultaneously changing as a

              contribution made by the high quality of the offspring owing to
              nonrandom mate choice. To investigate the determinants of
              lifetime fitness, we measured offspring production, longevity,
              and lifetime number of mates in four cohorts of two long-lived
              species of socially monogamous Darwin's finch species, Geospiza

              previous theory suggests that the conditions for multilocus
              polymorphism are restrictive. Here, we explore a more general
              class of models with multilocus seasonally fluctuating selection
              in diploids. In these models, the multilocus genotype is mapped
              to fitness in two steps. The first mapping is additive across
              loci and accounts for the relative contributions of heterozygous
              and homozygous loci-that is, dominance. The second step uses a
              nonlinear fitness function to account for the strength of
              selection and epistasis. Using mathematical analysis and
              individual-based simulations, we show that stable polymorphism at
              many loci is possible if currently favored alleles are

              antagonistic pleiotropy and seasonal changes in the relative

               selection in nature is lacking. Here, we assembled a database of
               temporal replicates of selection from studies of wild
               populations to synthesize what we do (and do not) know about the

               both direct and indirect selection as well as linear and
               nonlinear selection. Morphological traits and studies focused on
               vertebrates were well-represented, with other traits and
               taxonomic groups less well-represented. Overall, three major
               features characterize the temporal dynamics of selection. First,
               the strength of selection often varies considerably from year to
               year, although random sampling error of selection coefficients
               may impose bias in estimates of the magnitude of such variation.
               Second, changes in the direction of selection are frequent.
               Third, changes in the form of selection are likely common, but
               harder to quantify. Although few studies have identified causal
               mechanisms underlying temporal variation in the strength,
               direction and form of selection, variation in environmental

  abstract  = "Adaptation in eukaryotes is generally assumed to be
               mutation-limited because of small effective population sizes.
               This view is difficult to reconcile, however, with the
               observation that adaptation to anthropogenic changes, such as
               the introduction of pesticides, can occur very rapidly. Here we
               investigate adaptation at a key insecticide resistance locus
               (Ace) in Drosophila melanogaster and show that multiple simple
               and complex resistance alleles evolved quickly and repeatedly
               within individual populations. Our results imply that the
               current effective population size of modern D. melanogaster
               populations is likely to be substantially larger (> or =
               100-fold) than commonly believed. This discrepancy arises
               because estimates of the effective population size are generally
               derived from levels of standing variation and thus reveal
               long-term population dynamics dominated by sharp--even if
               infrequent--bottlenecks. The short-term effective population
               sizes relevant for strong adaptation, on the other hand, might
               be much closer to census population sizes. Adaptation in
               Drosophila may therefore not be limited by waiting for mutations
               at single sites, and complex adaptive alleles can be generated
               quickly without fixation of intermediate states. Adaptive events
               should also commonly involve the simultaneous rise in frequency
               of independently generated adaptive mutations. These so-called

              genetic variation at linked sites. Thus, in principle,
              adaptations can be mapped by looking for the signature of
              directional selection in polymorphism data. In practice, such
              efforts are hampered by the need for an accurate characterization
              of the demographic history of the species and of the effects of
              positive selection. In an attempt to circumvent these
              difficulties, researchers are increasingly taking a purely
              empirical approach, in which a large number of genomic regions
              are ordered by summaries of the polymorphism data, and loci with
              extreme values are considered to be likely targets of positive
              selection. We evaluated the reliability of the ``empirical''
              approach, focusing on applications to human data and to maize. To
              do so, we considered a coalescent model of directional selection
              in a sensible demographic setting, allowing for selection on
              standing variation as well as on a new mutation. Our simulations
              suggest that while empirical approaches will identify several
              interesting candidates, they will also miss many--in some cases,
              most--loci of interest. The extent of the trade-off depends on
              the mode of positive selection and the demographic history of the
              population. Specifically, the false-discovery rate is higher when
              directional selection involves a recessive rather than a
              co-dominant allele, when it acts on a previously neutral rather
              than a new allele, and when the population has experienced a
              population bottleneck rather than maintained a constant size. One
              implication of these results is that, insofar as attributes of
              the beneficial mutation (e.g., the dominance coefficient) affect
              the power to detect targets of selection, genomic scans will

               histories of natural populations across a broad range of
               organisms. As demographic events alter coalescent genealogies,
               they leave detectable signatures in patterns of genetic
               variation within and between populations. Accordingly, a variety
               of approaches have been designed to leverage population genetic
               data to uncover the footprints of demographic change in the
               genome. The vast majority of these methods make the simplifying
               assumption that the measures of genetic variation used as their
               input are unaffected by natural selection. However, natural
               selection can dramatically skew patterns of variation not only
               at selected sites, but at linked, neutral loci as well. Here we
               assess the impact of recent positive selection on demographic
               inference by characterizing the performance of three popular
               methods through extensive simulation of data sets with varying
               numbers of linked selective sweeps. In particular, we examined
               three different demographic models relevant to a number of
               species, finding that positive selection can bias parameter
               estimates of each of these models-often severely. We find that
               selection can lead to incorrect inferences of population size
               changes when none have occurred. Moreover, we show that linked
               selection can lead to incorrect demographic model selection,
               when multiple demographic scenarios are compared. We argue that
               natural populations may experience the amount of recent positive
               selection required to skew inferences. These results suggest
               that demographic studies conducted in many species to date may

              rapidly reversed when selection ceases. This change is due
              entirely to the correlation between pairs of loci which is
              induced by selection; the correlation is negative, leading to a
              reduction in the genetic variance under stabilizing or
              directional selection, and is positive, leading to an increase in
              the variance under disruptive selection. When selection ceases,
              the correlation rapidly disappears as joint equilibrium at pairs
              of loci is reestablished, and the variance returns to its

               to estimate the effective population size (N(e)) on the basis of
               the observed changes of marker allele frequencies over time, and
               these have been applied to a large variety of species and
               populations. Such methods invariably make the critical
               assumption of a single isolated population receiving no
               immigrants over the study interval. For most populations in the
               real world, however, migration is not negligible and can
               substantially bias estimates of N(e) if it is not accounted for.
               Here we extend previous moment and maximum-likelihood methods to
               allow the joint estimation of N(e) and migration rate (m) using
               genetic samples over space and time. It is shown that, compared
               to genetic drift acting alone, migration results in changes in
               allele frequency that are greater in the short term and smaller
               in the long term, leading to under- and overestimation of N(e),

               generates negative linkage disequilibrium, on average, even if
               selection acts independently (i.e., multiplicatively) upon all
               loci. Negative disequilibrium reduces the variance in fitness
               and hence, by Fisher's (1930) fundamental theorem, slows the
               rate of increase in mean fitness. Modifiers that increase
               recombination eliminate the negative disequilibria that impede
               selection and consequently increase in frequency by
               ``hitchhiking.'' Thus, stochastic fluctuations in linkage
               disequilibrium in finite populations favor the evolution of
               increased rates of recombination, even in the absence of
               epistatic interactions among loci and even when disequilibrium

               modifier allele that increases recombination in a finite
               population. The analysis indicates that stochastically generated
               linkage disequilibria do select for increased recombination, a
               result that is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations. Selection
               for a modifier that increases recombination is highest when
               linkage among loci is tight, when beneficial alleles rise from

               of Wisconsin-Madison and at Stanford University, it is
               specifically designed for use over two semesters, offers
               students the most thorough grounding in introductory statistical
               inference, and offers a substantial amount of interpretive

               between rigor and intuition, and provokes students to form their
               own critical opinions. A Course in Econometrics thoroughly
               covers the fundamentals--classical regression and simultaneous

               asymptotic theory and nonlinear regression. To accommodate
               students with various levels of preparation, the text opens with
               a thorough review of statistical concepts and methods, then
               proceeds to the regression model and its variants. Bold

              the rate and strength of beneficial substitutions-remains
              tentative. Here, we use genome-wide polymorphism data in D.
              simulans and sequenced genomes of its close relatives to
              construct a readily interpretable characterization of the effects
              of positive selection: the shape of average neutral diversity
              around amino acid substitutions. As expected under recurrent
              selective sweeps, we find a trough in diversity levels around
              amino acid but not around synonymous substitutions, a distinctive
              pattern that is not expected under alternative models. This
              characterization is richer than previous approaches, which relied
              on limited summaries of the data (e.g., the slope of a scatter
              plot), and relates to underlying selection parameters in a
              straightforward way, allowing us to make more reliable inferences
              about the prevalence and strength of adaptation. Specifically, we
              develop a coalescent-based model for the shape of the entire
              curve and use it to infer adaptive parameters by maximum
              likelihood. Our inference suggests that ∼13\% of amino acid
              substitutions cause selective sweeps. Interestingly, it reveals
              two classes of beneficial fixations: a minority (approximately
              3\%) that appears to have had large selective effects and
              accounts for most of the reduction in diversity, and the
              remaining 10\%, which seem to have had very weak selective
              effects. These estimates therefore help to reconcile the apparent
              conflict among previously published estimates of the strength of
              selection. More generally, our findings provide unequivocal
              evidence for strongly beneficial substitutions in Drosophila and

               patterns are different when adaptation responds quickly to a
               novel selection pressure, acting either on standing genetic
               variation or on recurrent new mutation. In the past decade,
               corresponding footprints of ?soft? selective sweeps have been
               described both in theoretical models and in empirical data.

               selective predation. The period of selection was associated with
               very cold temperatures averaging up to 4°C below normal and an
               overall mortality of nearly 75\%. There was no change in morph
               frequency, near normal temperatures and a lower mortality from
               February to early April. Examination of groups of nearby trees
               in late January strongly suggested that similar differential
               mortality had occurred except on some willows. This difference
               was probably due to the more protected hibernation sites
               available on these trees. Samples of hibernating cohorts at
               three other sites showed no evidence of differential mortality.
               Laboratory experiments with hibernating beetles found no
               difference in survivorship or rate of weight loss between
               starved non-melanics and melanics in temperature regimes with
               and without periods of adult activity. It is concluded that the
               intense winter selection on the study limes is probably
               exceptional. Examination of changes in morph frequency through
               the annual cycle suggests that at some sites the selection
               favouring melanics during reproduction is counterbalanced by
               selection against melanics in late summer or early autumn. The
               results are discussed in relation to mathematical models of
               cyclical selection and to other field studies including that of

              to drive reversals in the direction of selection among different
              time periods and may also be responsible for intense episodic
              selection caused by rare weather events. We measured viability
              selection associated with morphological traits in cliff swallows
              (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) in western Nebraska, USA, over a
              14-year period following a rare climatic event. We used
              mark-recapture to estimate the annual apparent survival of over
              26 000 individuals whose wing, tail, tarsus and bill had been

              traits'') have lower heritabilities than traits more distantly
              associated with fitness has traditionally been framed in terms of
              Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection-fitness traits
              are expected to have low levels of additive genetic variance due
              to rapid fixation of alleles conferring highest fitness.
              Subsequent treatments have challenged this view by pointing out
              that high environmental and nonadditive genetic contributions to
              phenotypic variation may also explain the low heritability of
              fitness traits. Analysis of a large data set from the collared
              flycatcher Ficedula albicollis confirmed a previous finding that
              traits closely associated with fitness tend to have lower
              heritability. However, analysis of coefficients of additive
              genetic variation (CVA) revealed that traits closely associated
              with fitness had higher levels of additive genetic variation (VA)
              than traits more distantly associated with fitness. Hence, the
              negative relationship between a trait's association with fitness
              and its heritability was not due to lower levels of VA in fitness
              traits but was due to their higher residual variance. However,
              whether the high residual variance was mainly due to higher
              levels of environmental variance or due to higher levels of
              nonadditive genetic variance remains a challenge to be addressed

              Mal{\'e}cot introduced FST as a measure of structure in natural
              populations. In the decades that followed, a number of papers
              provided differing definitions, estimation methods, and
              interpretations beyond Wright's. While this diversity in methods
              has enabled many studies in genetics, it has also introduced
              confusion regarding how to estimate FST from available data.
              Considering this confusion, wide variation in published estimates
              of FST for pairs of HapMap populations is a cause for concern.
              These estimates changed-in some cases more than twofold-when
              comparing estimates from genotyping arrays to those from sequence
              data. Indeed, changes in FST from sequencing data might be
              expected due to population genetic factors affecting rare
              variants. While rare variants do influence the result, we show
              that this is largely through differences in estimation methods.
              Correcting for this yields estimates of FST that are much more
              concordant between sequence and genotype data. These differences
              relate to three specific issues: (1) estimating FST for a single
              SNP, (2) combining estimates of FST across multiple SNPs, and (3)
              selecting the set of SNPs used in the computation. Changes in
              each of these aspects of estimation may result in FST estimates
              that are highly divergent from one another. Here, we clarify
              these issues and propose solutions.",

  abstract = "Large populations may contain numerous simultaneously segregating
              polymorphisms subject to natural selection. Since selection acts
              on individuals whose fitness depends on many loci, different loci
              affect each other's dynamics. This leads to stochastic
              fluctuations of allele frequencies above and beyond genetic
              drift-an effect known as genetic draft. Since recombination
              disrupts associations between alleles, draft is strong when
              recombination is rare. Here, we study a facultatively outcrossing
              population in a regime where the frequency of outcrossing and
              recombination, r, is small compared to the characteristic scale
              of fitness differences $\sigma$. In this regime, fit genotypes
              expand clonally, leading to large fluctuations in the number of
              recombinant offspring genotypes. The power law tail in the
              distribution of the latter makes it impossible to capture the
              dynamics of draft by an effective neutral model. Instead, we find
              that the fixation time of a neutral allele increases only slowly
              with the population size but depends sensitively on the ratio
              r/$\sigma$. The efficacy of selection is reduced dramatically and
              alleles behave ``quasi-neutrally'' even for Ns≫1, provided that
              |s| < s(c), where s(c) depends strongly on r/$\sigma$, but only
              weakly on population size N. In addition, the anomalous
              fluctuations due to draft change the spectrum of (quasi)-neutral
              alleles from f($\nu$) ∼ $\nu$(-1), corresponding to drift, to ∼
              $\nu$(-2). Finally, draft accelerates the rate of two-step

  title     = "Evolution of life in urban environments",
  author    = "Johnson, Marc T J and Munshi-South, Jason",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND The extent of urban areas is increasing around the
               world, and most humans now live in cities. Urbanization results
               in dramatic environmental change, including increased
               temperatures, more impervious surface cover, altered hydrology,
               and elevated pollution. Urban areas also host more non-native
               species and reduced abundance and diversity of many native
               species. These environmental changes brought by global
               urbanization are creating novel ecosystems with unknown
               consequences for the evolution of life. Here, we consider how
               early human settlements led to the evolution of human
               commensals, including some of the most notorious pests and
               disease vectors. We also comprehensively review how contemporary
               urbanization affects the evolution of species that coinhabit
               cities.ADVANCES A recent surge of research shows that
               urbanization affects both nonadaptive and adaptive evolution.
               Some of the clearest results of urban evolution show that cities
               elevate the strength of random genetic drift (stochastic changes
               in allele frequencies) and restrict gene flow (the movement of
               alleles between populations due to dispersal and mating).
               Populations of native species in cities often represent either
               relicts that predate urbanization or populations that
               established after a city formed. Both scenarios frequently
               result in a loss of genetic diversity within populations and
               increased differentiation between populations. Fragmentation and
               urban infrastructure also create barriers to dispersal, and
               consequently, gene flow is often reduced among city populations,
               which further contributes to genetic differentiation between
               populations.The influence of urbanization on mutation and
               adaptive evolution are less clear. A small number of studies
               suggest that industrial pollution can elevate mutation rates,
               but the pervasiveness of this effect is unknown. A better
               studied phenomenon are the effects of urbanization on evolution
               by natural selection. A growing number of studies show that
               plant and animal populations experience divergent selection
               between urban and nonurban environments. This divergent
               selection has led to adaptive evolution in life history,
               morphology, physiology, behavior, and reproductive traits. These
               adaptations typically evolve in response to pesticide use,
               pollution, local climate, or the physical structure of cities.
               Despite these important results, the genetic basis of adaptive
               evolution is known from only a few cases. Most studies also
               examine only a few populations in one city, and experimental
               validation is rare.OUTLOOK The study of evolution in urban areas
               provides insights into both fundamental and applied problems in
               biology. The thousands of cities throughout the world share some
               features while differing in other aspects related to their age,
               historical context, governmental policies, and local climate.
               Thus, the phenomenon of global urbanization represents an
               unintended but highly replicated global study of experimental
               evolution. We can harness this global urban experiment to
               understand the repeatability and pace of evolution in response
               to human activity. Among the most important unresolved questions
               is, how often do native and exotic species adapt to the
               particular environmental challenges found in cities? Such
               adaptations could be the difference as to whether a species
               persists or vanishes from urban areas. In this way, the study of
               urban evolution can help us understand how evolution in
               populations may contribute to conservation of rare species, and
               how populations can be managed to facilitate the establishment
               of resilient and sustainable urban ecosystems. In a similar way,
               understanding evolution in urban areas can lead to improved
               human health. For example, human pests frequently adapt to
               pesticides and evade control efforts because of our limited
               understanding of the size of populations and movement of
               individuals. Applied evolutionary studies could lead to more
               effective mitigation of pests and disease agents. The study of
               urban evolution has rapidly become an important frontier in
               biology, with implications for healthy and sustainable human
               populations in urban ecosystems.",

              variation correlate with recombination rate among 20 gene regions
              from across the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. It has been
              suggested that this correlation results from genetic hitchhiking
              associated with the fixation of strongly selected mutants. The
              hitchhiking process can be described as a series of two-step
              events. The first step consists of a strongly selected
              substitution wiping out linked variation in a population; this is
              followed by a recovery period in which polymorphism can build up
              via neutral mutations and random genetic drift. Genetic
              hitchhiking has previously been modeled as a steady-state process
              driven by recurring selected substitutions. We show here that the
              characteristic parameter of this steady-state model is alpha v,
              the product of selection intensity (alpha = 2Ns) and the
              frequency of beneficial mutations v (where N is population size
              and s is the selective advantage of the favored allele). We also
              demonstrate that the steady-state model describes the hitchhiking
              process adequately, unless the recombination rate is very low. To
              estimate alpha v, we use the data of DNA sequence variation from
              17 D. melanogaster loci from regions of intermediate to high
              recombination rates. We find that alpha v is likely to be > 1.3 x
              10(-8). Additional data are needed to estimate this parameter
              more precisely. The estimation of alpha v is important, as this

              strongly selected substitutions.",

              theory have been applied to the resulting data and suggest that
              most mutations affecting functionally important sequences are
              deleterious but subject to very weak selection. Quantitative
              genetic studies have provided information on the extent of
              genetic variation within populations in traits related to fitness
              and the rate at which variability in these traits arises by

              of beneficial mutations (selective sweeps) or the response of
              many quantitative trait loci drive adaptation to environmental
              changes. Although much attention has been given to the genomic
              footprint of selective sweeps, the importance of selection on
              quantitative traits is still not well studied, as the associated

              'Evolve and Resequence' as a promising tool, to study polygenic
              adaptation of quantitative traits in evolving populations.
              Simulating replicated time series data we show that adaptation to
              a new intermediate trait optimum has three characteristic phases
              that are reflected on the genomic level: (1) directional
              frequency changes towards the new trait optimum, (2) plateauing
              of allele frequencies when the new trait optimum has been reached

              characteristics for relevant population genetic parameters to

              Remarkably, over a broad range of parameters the trajectories of

               article reviews the theory of such genetic hitchhiking,
               concentrating on effects on neutral loci. Maynard Smith and
               Haigh introduced the classical case where the perturbation is
               due to a single favourable mutation. This is contrasted with the
               apparently distinct effects of inherited variation in fitness
               due to loosely linked loci. A model of fluctuating selection is
               analysed which bridges these alternative treatments. When
               alleles sweep between extreme frequencies at a rate lambda, the
               rate of drift is increased by a factor (1 +
               E[1/pq]lambda/(2(2lambda + r))), where the recombination rate r
               is much smaller than the strength of selection. In spatially
               structured populations, the effects of any one substitution are
               weaker, and only cause a local increase in the frequency of a
               neutral allele. This increase depends primarily on the rate of
               recombination relative to selection (r/s), and more weakly, on
               the neighbourhood size, Nb = 4(pi rho sigma)2. Spatial
               subdivision may allow local selective sweeps to occur more
               frequently than is indicated by the overall rate of molecular
               evolution. However, it seems unlikely that such sweeps can be

               or high levels of linkage disequilibrium, relative to a neutral
               model of a random-mating population of constant size. These are
               features expected after a recent selective sweep. Their
               prevalence suggests that positive directional selection may be
               widespread in both species. However, as I show here, these
               features do not persist long after the sweep ends: The
               high-frequency alleles drift to fixation and no longer
               contribute to polymorphism, while linkage disequilibrium is

               selection acts on linked loci, it introduces correlations along
               the genome that are difficult to disentangle. These
               ``interference'' effects have been extensively studied in
               simulation, but theory still struggles to account for
               interference in predicted patterns of sequence variability,
               which limits the quantitative conclusions that can be drawn from
               modern sequence data. Here, we show that in spite of this
               complexity, simple behavior emerges in the limit that
               interference is common. Patterns of molecular evolution depend
               on the variance in fitness within the population, and are only
               weakly influenced by the fitness effects of individual
               mutations. We leverage this ``emergent simplicity'' to establish
               a new framework for predicting genetic diversity in these
               populations. Our results have important practical implications
               for the interpretation of natural sequence variability,
               particularly in regions of low recombination, and suggest an
               inherent ``resolution limit'' for the quantitative inference of
               selection pressures from sequence polymorphism data.",

               Nevertheless, the process of character displacement occurring in
               nature, from the initial encounter of competitors to the
               evolutionary change in one or more of them, has not previously

               ( Geospiza fortis ) on an undisturbed Gal{\'a}pagos island
               diverged in beak size from a competitor species ( G.
               magnirostris ) 22 years after the competitor's arrival, when
               they jointly and severely depleted the food supply. The observed

               recorded in 33 years of study, and close to the value predicted
               from the high heritability of beak size. These findings support

               genetics is the profound effect that natural selection on one
               locus can have on genetic variation patterns at linked loci.
               Since the first evidence for linked selection was uncovered in
               Drosophila melanogaster over two decades ago, substantial effort
               has focused on quantifying the effects and on distinguishing the
               relative contributions of purifying and positive selection. We
               introduce an approach to jointly model the effects of positive
               and negative selection along the genome and infer selection
               parameters. To this end, we consider how closely linked each
               neutral site is to different types of annotations and
               substitutions. When we apply the inference method to genome-wide
               data from 125 D. melanogaster lines, our model explains most of
               the variance in diversity levels at the megabase scale and
               allows us to distinguish among the contribution of different
               modes of selection on proteins and UTRs. More generally, we
               provide a map of the effects of natural selection along the
               genome, and show that selection at linked sites has had an even
               more drastic effect on diversity patterns than previously
               appreciated. We also make a tool available to apply this

               under a specific selection regime has become a popular approach
               to determine genotype-phenotype maps and understand adaptation
               to new environments. Despite its conceptual appeal and success
               in identifying some causative genes, it has become apparent that
               many studies suffer from an excess of candidate loci. Several
               explanations have been proposed for this phenomenon, but it is
               clear that information about the linkage structure during such
               experiments is needed. Until now only Pool-Seq (whole-genome
               sequencing of pools of individuals) data were available, which
               do not provide sufficient information about the correlation
               between linked sites. We address this problem in two
               complementary analyses of three replicate Drosophila
               melanogaster populations evolving to a new hot temperature
               environment for almost 70 generations. In the first analysis, we
               sequenced 58 haploid genomes from the founder population and
               evolved flies at generation 67. We show that during the
               experiment linkage disequilibrium (LD) increased almost
               uniformly over much greater distances than typically seen in
               Drosophila. In the second analysis, Pool-Seq time series data of
               the three replicates were combined with haplotype information
               from the founder population to follow blocks of initial
               haplotypes over time. We identified 17 selected haplotype-blocks
               that started at low frequencies in the base population and
               increased in frequency during the experiment. The size of these
               haplotype-blocks ranged from 0.082 to 4.01 Mb. Moreover, between
               42\% and 46\% of the top candidate single nucleotide
               polymorphisms from the comparison of founder and evolved
               populations fell into the genomic region covered by the
               haplotype-blocks. We conclude that LD in such rising
               haplotype-blocks results in long range hitchhiking over multiple
               kilobase-sized regions. LD in such haplotype-blocks is therefore
               a major factor contributing to an excess of candidate loci.
               Although modifications of the experimental design may help to
               reduce the hitchhiking effect and allow for more precise mapping
               of causative variants, we also note that such haplotype-blocks
               might be well suited to study the dynamics of selected genomic
               regions during experimental evolution studies.",

               arbitrary modes of inheritance, including diploidy, polyploidy,

               The framework is also extended to allow for other deterministic

               recursions that fully describe the state of the population are

               assortative mating. The general equation for the case of equal
               number of sexes and constant number of breeding individuals (N)
               is Ne = 4N/[2(1 - alpha I) + (Sk2 + 4Q2C2) (1 + alpha I + 2
               alpha O)], where Sk2 is the variance of family size due to
               sampling without selection, C2 is the variance of selective
               advantages among families (the squared coefficient of variation
               of the expected number of offspring per family), alpha I is the
               deviation from Hardy-Weinberg proportions, alpha O is the
               correlation between genes of male and female parents, and Q2 is
               the term accounting for the cumulative effect of selection on an
               inherited trait. This is obtained as Q = 2/[2 - G(1 + r)], where
               G is the remaining proportion of genetic variance in selected
               individuals and r is the correlation of the expected selective
               values of male and female parents. The method is also extended
               to the general case of different numbers of male and female
               parents. The predictive value of the formulae is tested under a
               model of truncation selection with the infinitesimal model of
               gene effects, where C2 and G are a function of the selection
               intensity, the heritability and the intraclass correlation of
               sibs. Under random mating r = alpha I = -1/(N - 1) and alpha O =
               0. Under partial full-sib mating with an average proportion beta
               of full-sib matings per generation, r approximately beta and
               alpha O approximately alpha I approximately beta/(4 - 3 beta).
               The prediction equation is compared to other approximations
               based on the long-term contributions of ancestors to
               descendants. Finally, based on the approach followed, a system
               of mating (compensatory mating) is proposed to reduce rates of
               inbreeding without loss of response in selection programs in

               colonies of the moth Panaxia dominula, begun by R. A. Fisher, E.
               B. Ford and P. M. Sheppard, have long been regarded as a model
               study of natural selection under field conditions. Recently,
               their conclusions have been criticized, on the grounds that
               phenotypes have been improperly scored and that population
               structure has been misunderstood. The results are re-examined
               here, including recent unpublished collections. It is argued
               that the colonies studied are distinct populations, as usually
               defined, and that the results could not arise as a result of
               migration. Fluctuation in population size from year to year,
               large variance in fecundity and some features of mating
               behaviour probably reduce the effective number to less than half
               the estimated population size. Variable expressivity and
               consequent subjective variation in scoring, casts some doubt on
               earlier claims that selection fluctuates significantly from
               generation to generation, and on a reported case of increase in
               frequency from a very low starting point. However, the one
               natural and three artificial colonies studied are consistent in
               providing estimates of selection of 7 per cent or more against
               medionigra, despite the variation introduced by small population
               size and scoring difficulties. There appears to be an
               equilibrium at a low frequency, and the rate of approach to it
               suggests that the selection is frequency dependent. One
               artificial colony, at West Kirby on the Wirral, Merseyside,
               U.K., does not show an equivalent decline. Selection cannot be

               allele model using an efficient Monte Carlo method. An often
               used approximation for the mean squared linkage disequilibrium
               is shown to be inaccurate unless the proper statistical
               conditioning is used. The joint distribution of linkage
               disequilibrium and the allele frequencies in the sample is
               studied. This estimated joint distribution is sufficient for
               obtaining an approximate maximum likelihood estimate of C = 4Nc,
               where N is the population size and c is the recombination rate.
               It has been suggested that observations of high linkage
               disequilibrium might be a good basis for rejecting a neutral
               model in favor of a model in which natural selection maintains
               genetic variation. It is found that a single sample of
               chromosomes, examined at two loci cannot provide sufficient
               information for such a test if C C this small, very high levels
               of linkage disequilibrium are not unexpected under the neutral

               as large as 50, the distribution of linkage disequilibrium
               conditional on the allele frequencies is substantially different
               from the distribution when there is no linkage between the loci.

  abstract  = "Two major sources of stochasticity in the dynamics of neutral
               alleles result from resampling of finite populations (genetic
               drift) and the random genetic background of nearby selected
               alleles on which the neutral alleles are found (linked
               selection). There is now good evidence that linked selection
               plays an important role in shaping polymorphism levels in a
               number of species. One of the best-investigated models of linked
               selection is the recurrent full-sweep model, in which newly
               arisen selected alleles fix rapidly. However, the bulk of
               selected alleles that sweep into the population may not be
               destined for rapid fixation. Here we develop a general model of
               recurrent selective sweeps in a coalescent framework, one that
               generalizes the recurrent full-sweep model to the case where
               selected alleles do not sweep to fixation. We show that in a
               large population, only the initial rapid increase of a selected
               allele affects the genealogy at partially linked sites, which
               under fairly general assumptions are unaffected by the
               subsequent fate of the selected allele. We also apply the theory
               to a simple model to investigate the impact of recurrent partial
               sweeps on levels of neutral diversity and find that for a given
               reduction in diversity, the impact of recurrent partial sweeps
               on the frequency spectrum at neutral sites is determined
               primarily by the frequencies rapidly achieved by the selected
               alleles. Consequently, recurrent sweeps of selected alleles to
               low frequencies can have a profound effect on levels of
               diversity but can leave the frequency spectrum relatively
               unperturbed. In fact, the limiting coalescent model under a high
               rate of sweeps to low frequency is identical to the standard
               neutral model. The general model of selective sweeps we describe
               goes some way toward providing a more flexible framework to
               describe genomic patterns of diversity than is currently

               selection on many loci, and apply it to strong truncation and
               disruptive selection on an additive polygenic trait. We first
               present statistical methods for analyzing the infinitesimal
               model, in which offspring breeding values are normally
               distributed around the mean of the parents, with fixed variance.
               These show that the usual assumption of a Gaussian distribution
               of breeding values in the population gives remarkably accurate
               predictions for the mean and the variance, even when disruptive
               selection generates substantial deviations from normality. We
               then set out a general genetic analysis of selection and
               recombination. The population is represented by multilocus
               cumulants describing the distribution of haploid genotypes, and
               selection is described by the relation between mean fitness and
               these cumulants. We provide exact recursions in terms of
               generating functions for the effects of selection on non-central
               moments. The effects of recombination are simply calculated as a
               weighted sum over all the permutations produced by meiosis.
               Finally, the new cumulants that describe the next generation are
               computed from the non-central moments. Although this scheme is
               applied here in detail only to selection on an additive trait,
               it is quite general. For arbitrary epistasis and linkage, we
               describe a consistent infinitesimal limit in which the
               short-term selection response is dominated by infinitesimal
               allele frequency changes and linkage disequilibria. Numerical
               multilocus results show that the standard Gaussian approximation
               gives accurate predictions for the dynamics of the mean and
               genetic variance in this limit. Even with intense truncation
               selection, linkage disequilibria of order three and higher never
               cause much deviation from normality. Thus, the empirical
               deviations frequently found between predicted and observed
               responses to artificial selection are not caused by
               linkage-disequilibrium-induced departures from normality.
               Disruptive selection can generate substantial four-way
               disequilibria, and hence kurtosis; but even then, the Gaussian
               assumption predicts the variance accurately. In contrast to the
               apparent simplicity of the infinitesimal limit, data suggest
               that changes in genetic variance after 10 or more generations of
               selection are likely to be dominated by allele frequency
               dynamics that depend on genetic details.",

               probability of an allele that can find itself in a variety of
               genetic backgrounds is applied to find the effect of
               substitutions, fluctuating polymorphisms, and deleterious
               mutations in a large population. With loose linkage, r, the
               effects depend on the additive genetic variance in relative
               fitness, var(W), and act by reducing effective population size
               by (N/Ne) = 1 + var(W)/2r2. However, tightly linked loci can
               have a substantial effect not predictable from Ne. Linked
               deleterious mutations reduce the fixation probability of weakly
               favored alleles by exp (-2U/R), where U is the total mutation
               rate and R is the map length in Morgans. Substitutions can cause
               a greater reduction: an allele with advantage s < scrit = (pi
               2/6) loge (S/s) \textbackslash[var(W)/R] is very unlikely to be
               fixed. (S is the advantage of the substitution impeding
               fixation.) Fluctuating polymorphisms at many (n) linked loci can
               also have a substantial effect, reducing fixation probability by

               the expectation under neutrality. We present a likelihood method
               for detecting selective sweeps that involves jointly modeling
               the multilocus allele frequency differentiation between two
               populations. We use Brownian motion to model genetic drift under
               neutrality, and a deterministic model to approximate the effect
               of a selective sweep on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)

               data, and demonstrate that in some scenarios the method provides
               higher power than previously reported approaches to detect
               selective sweeps, and can provide surprisingly good localization
