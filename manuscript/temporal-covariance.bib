              central problem of evolutionary biology. This issue has been
              fruitfully addressed by examining genetic differentiation between

              rates of gene flow. A good example of this approach is the
              decades-long investigation of selection acting along latitudinal
              clines in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we use next-generation
              genome sequencing to reexamine the well-studied Australian D.
              melanogaster cline. We find evidence for extensive
              differentiation between temperate and tropical populations, with
              regulatory regions and unannotated regions showing particularly
              high levels of differentiation. Although the physical genomic
              scale of geographic differentiation is small--on the order of
              gene sized--we observed several larger highly differentiated
              regions. The region spanned by the cosmopolitan inversion
              polymorphism In(3R)P shows higher levels of differentiation,
              consistent with the major difference in allele frequencies of
              Standard and In(3R)P karyotypes in temperate vs. tropical

               to identify regions of the genome that underlie recent
               adaptations. These searches are guided by a simple model of
               positive selection, in which a mutation is favored as soon as it
               arises. This assumption may not be realistic, as environmental
               changes and range expansions may lead previously neutral or
               deleterious alleles to become beneficial. We examine what effect
               this mode of selection has on patterns of variation at linked
               neutral sites by implementing a new coalescent model of positive
               directional selection on standing variation. In this model, a
               neutral allele arises and drifts in the population, then at
               frequency f becomes beneficial, and eventually reaches fixation.
               Depending on the value of f, this scenario can lead to a large
               variance in allele frequency spectra and in levels of linkage
               disequilibrium at linked, neutral sites. In particular, for

              producing distinct patterns of genetic variation in the vicinity

              designed to detect hard sweeps and most lack power to detect soft

              adaptation in species such as Drosophila melanogaster, where all
              three confirmed cases of recent adaptation resulted in soft

  abstract = "Natural selection can produce a correlation between local
              recombination rates and levels of neutral DNA polymorphism as a
              consequence of genetic hitchhiking and background selection.
              Theory suggests that selection at linked sites should affect
              patterns of neutral variation in partially selfing populations
              more dramatically than in outcrossing populations. However,
              empirical investigations of selection at linked sites have
              focused primarily on outcrossing species. To assess the potential
              role of selection as a determinant of neutral polymorphism in the
              context of partial self-fertilization, we conducted a
              multivariate analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
              density throughout the genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis
              elegans. We based the analysis on a published SNP data set and
              partitioned the genome into windows to calculate SNP densities,
              recombination rates, and gene densities across all six
              chromosomes. Our analyses identify a strong, positive correlation
              between recombination rate and neutral polymorphism (as estimated
              by noncoding SNP density) across the genome of C. elegans.
              Furthermore, we find that levels of neutral polymorphism are
              lower in gene-dense regions than in gene-poor regions in some
              analyses. Analyses incorporating local estimates of divergence
              between C. elegans and C. briggsae indicate that a mutational
              explanation alone is unlikely to explain the observed patterns.
              Consequently, we interpret these findings as evidence that
              natural selection shapes genome-wide patterns of neutral
              polymorphism in C. elegans. Our study provides the first
              demonstration of such an effect in a partially selfing animal.
              Explicit models of genetic hitchhiking and background selection
              can each adequately describe the relationship between
              recombination rate and SNP density, but only when they
              incorporate selfing rate. Clarification of the relative roles of
              genetic hitchhiking and background selection in C. elegans awaits

               calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely

               equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is

              generations in both natural and lab populations is increasingly
              used to find selected loci underpinning such rapid adaptation.
              Although selection on large effect loci may be detectable in such
              data, often the fitness differences between individuals have a
              polygenic architecture, such that selection at any one locus
              leads to allele frequency changes that are too subtle to
              distinguish from genetic drift. However, one promising signal
              comes from the fact that selection on polygenic traits leads to
              heritable fitness backgrounds that neutral alleles can become
              stochastically associated with. These associations perturb
              neutral allele frequency trajectories, creating autocovariance
              across generations that can be directly measured from temporal
              genomic data. We develop theory that predicts the magnitude of
              these temporal autocovariances, showing that it is determined by
              the level of additive genetic variation, recombination, and
              linkage disequilibria in a region. Furthermore, by using analytic
              expressions for the temporal variances and autocovariances in
              allele frequency, we demonstrate one can estimate the additive
              genetic variation for fitness and the drift-effective population
              size from temporal genomic data. Finally, we also show how the

               concentrated in growth-related genes. However, a supercluster of

               Parallel phenotypic changes thus masked highly divergent genomic
               responses to selection, illustrating how contingent rapid

              or several quantitative traits are described as the sum of a
              genetic and a non-genetic component, the first being distributed
              within families as a normal random variable centred at the
              average of the parental genetic components, and with a variance
              independent of the parental traits. Thus, the variance that
              segregates within families is not perturbed by selection, and can
              be predicted from the variance components. This does not
              necessarily imply that the trait distribution across the whole
              population should be Gaussian, and indeed selection or population
              structure may have a substantial effect on the overall trait
              distribution. One of our main aims is to identify some general
              conditions on the allelic effects for the infinitesimal model to
              be accurate. We first review the long history of the
              infinitesimal model in quantitative genetics. Then we formulate
              the model at the phenotypic level in terms of individual trait
              values and relationships between individuals, but including
              different evolutionary processes: genetic drift, recombination,
              selection, mutation, population structure, …. We give a range of
              examples of its application to evolutionary questions related to

              epistatic effects. We prove in particular that, within each
              family, the genetic components of the individual trait values in
              the current generation are indeed normally distributed with a
              variance independent of ancestral traits, up to an error of order

              contribute to local adaptation. But if most alleles contributing
              to standing variation are of small effect, how does local
              adaptation proceed? Here I review predictions of population and
              quantitative genetic models and use individual-based simulations
              to illustrate how the architecture of local adaptation depends on
              the genetic redundancy of the trait, the maintenance of standing
              genetic variation (V(G)), and the susceptibility of alleles to
              swamping. Even when population genetic models predict swamping
              for individual alleles, considerable local adaptation can evolve
              at the phenotypic level if there is sufficient V(G). However, in
              such cases the underlying architecture of divergence is
              transient: F(ST) is low across all loci, and no locus makes an
              important contribution for very long. Because this kind of local
              adaptation is mainly due to transient frequency changes and
              allelic covariances, these architectures will be difficult--if
              not impossible--to detect using current approaches to studying
              the genomic basis of adaptation. Even when alleles are large and
              resistant to swamping, architectures can be highly transient if
              genetic redundancy and mutation rates are high. These results
              suggest that drift can play a critical role in shaping the
              architecture of local adaptation, both through eroding V(G) and

              signatures of selection and demography. Here, we sequence a new

              D. simulans, a valuable complement to the DGRP and other D.

              Alaska Earthquake abruptly created freshwater ponds on multiple
              islands in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska. In the
              short time since the earthquake, the phenotypes of resident
              freshwater threespine stickleback fish on at least three of these
              islands have changed dramatically from their oceanic ancestors.
              To test the hypothesis that these freshwater populations were
              derived from oceanic ancestors only 50 y ago, we generated over
              130,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism genotypes from more than
              1,000 individuals using restriction site-associated DNA

              support the hypothesis of recent and repeated, independent

              evidence of recurrent gene flow between oceanic and freshwater

              evolutionary process, we know little about how it is maintained.
              Obviously, mutation-selection balance must play a role, but there
              is considerable doubt over whether it can account for
              heritabilities as high as 0.5, which are commonly found in
              natural populations. Most models of mutation-selection balance
              assume panmictic populations. In this paper we use Monte Carlo
              simulations to examine the effect of isolation by distance on the
              variation maintained by mutation in a polygenic trait subject to
              optimizing selection. We show that isolation by distance can
              substantially increase the total variation maintained in
              continuous populations over a wide range of dispersal patterns,
              but only if more than one genotype produces the optimal phenotype
              (genetic redundancy). Isolation by distance alone has only a
              slight effect on the variation maintained in the total population
              for neutral alleles. The combined effect of isolation by distance
              and genetic redundancy, however, allows the maintenance of
              substantial variation despite strong stabilizing selection. The
              mechanism is straightforward. Isolation by distance allows
              mutation and drift to operate independently in different parts of
              the population. Because of their independent evolutionary
              histories, different parts of the population independently draw
              from the available set of redundant genotypes. Because the
              genotypes are redundant, selection does not discriminate among
              them, and they will persist until eliminated by drift. The
              population as a whole maintains many distinct genotypes. We show
              that this process allows mutation to maintain high levels of
              variation, even under strong stabilizing selection, and that over
              a moderate range of dispersal patterns the amount of variation
              maintained in the entire population is independent of both the
              strength of selection and the variance of the dispersal distance.
              Furthermore, we show that individual heterozygosity is increased
              in locally mating populations when selection is strong. Finally,
              our simulations provide a rough picture of how selection and the
              dispersal pattern influence the spatial distribution of genetic
              and phenotypic variation.",

              difficulty in detecting small allele frequency changes (AFCs)
              across many contributing loci. To resolve this, we use laboratory
              natural selection to detect signatures for selective sweeps and
              polygenic adaptation. We exposed 10 replicates of a Drosophila
              simulans population to a new temperature regime and uncovered a
              polygenic architecture of an adaptive trait with high genetic
              redundancy among beneficial alleles. We observed convergent
              responses for several phenotypes-e.g., fitness, metabolic rate,
              and fat content-and a strong polygenic response (99 selected
              alleles; mean s = 0.059). However, each of these selected alleles

              Rapidly changing population demographics complicate this

              fitness (recruitment) may be determined solely by producing many

              survival up to the point of breeding, or by an additional
              contribution made by the high quality of the offspring owing to
              nonrandom mate choice. To investigate the determinants of
              lifetime fitness, we measured offspring production, longevity,

              species of socially monogamous Darwin's finch species, Geospiza

  abstract = "In Drosophila, multiple lines of evidence converge in suggesting
              that beneficial substitutions to the genome may be common. All
              suffer from confounding factors, however, such that the
              interpretation of the evidence-in particular, conclusions about
              the rate and strength of beneficial substitutions-remains
              tentative. Here, we use genome-wide polymorphism data in D.
              simulans and sequenced genomes of its close relatives to
              construct a readily interpretable characterization of the effects
              of positive selection: the shape of average neutral diversity
              around amino acid substitutions. As expected under recurrent
              selective sweeps, we find a trough in diversity levels around
              amino acid but not around synonymous substitutions, a distinctive
              pattern that is not expected under alternative models. This
              characterization is richer than previous approaches, which relied
              on limited summaries of the data (e.g., the slope of a scatter
              plot), and relates to underlying selection parameters in a
              straightforward way, allowing us to make more reliable inferences
              about the prevalence and strength of adaptation. Specifically, we
              develop a coalescent-based model for the shape of the entire
              curve and use it to infer adaptive parameters by maximum
              likelihood. Our inference suggests that ∼13\% of amino acid
              substitutions cause selective sweeps. Interestingly, it reveals
              two classes of beneficial fixations: a minority (approximately
              3\%) that appears to have had large selective effects and
              accounts for most of the reduction in diversity, and the
              remaining 10\%, which seem to have had very weak selective
              effects. These estimates therefore help to reconcile the apparent
              conflict among previously published estimates of the strength of
              selection. More generally, our findings provide unequivocal
              evidence for strongly beneficial substitutions in Drosophila and
              illustrate how the rapidly accumulating genome-wide data can be
              leveraged to address enduring questions about the genetic basis

               mutation or migration, during the selective phase. In this case,
               descendants of several of these independent origins may

  author   = "Berg, Jeremy J and Coop, Graham",
  abstract = "The use of genetic polymorphism data to understand the dynamics
              of adaptation and identify the loci that are involved has become
              a major pursuit of modern evolutionary genetics. In addition to
              the classical ``hard sweep'' hitchhiking model, recent research
              has drawn attention to the fact that the dynamics of adaptation
              can play out in a variety of different ways and that the specific
              signatures left behind in population genetic data may depend
              somewhat strongly on these dynamics. One particular model for
              which a large number of empirical examples are already known is
              that in which a single derived mutation arises and drifts to some
              low frequency before an environmental change causes the allele to
              become beneficial and sweeps to fixation. Here, we pursue an
              analytical investigation of this model, bolstered and extended
              via simulation study. We use coalescent theory to develop an
              analytical approximation for the effect of a sweep from standing
              variation on the genealogy at the locus of the selected allele
              and sites tightly linked to it. We show that the distribution of
              haplotypes that the selected allele is present on at the time of
              the environmental change can be approximated by considering
              recombinant haplotypes as alleles in the infinite-alleles model.
              We show that this approximation can be leveraged to make accurate
              predictions regarding patterns of genetic polymorphism following
              such a sweep. We then use simulations to highlight which sources
              of haplotypic information are likely to be most useful in
              distinguishing this model from neutrality, as well as from other
              sweep models, such as the classic hard sweep and
              multiple-mutation soft sweeps. We find that in general,
              adaptation from a unique standing variant will likely be
              difficult to detect on the basis of genetic polymorphism data
              from a single population time point alone, and when it can be
              detected, it will be difficult to distinguish from other
              varieties of selective sweeps. Samples from multiple populations
              and/or time points have the potential to ease this difficulty.",

              Here we analyse the dynamics of molecular evolution in twelve
              experimental populations of Escherichia coli, using whole-genome

  author   = "Turelli, Michael",
  abstract = "Mendel (1866) suggested that if many heritable ``factors''
              contribute to a trait, near-continuous variation could result.
              Fisher (1918) clarified the connection between Mendelian
              inheritance and continuous trait variation by assuming many loci,
              each with small effect, and by informally invoking the central
              limit theorem. Barton et al. (2017) rigorously analyze the
              approach to a multivariate Gaussian distribution of the genetic
              effects for descendants of parents who may be related. This
              commentary distinguishes three nested approximations, referred to
              as ``infinitesimal genetics,'' ``Gaussian descendants'' and
              ``Gaussian population,'' each plausibly called ``the
              infinitesimal model.'' The first and most basic is Fisher's
              ``infinitesimal'' approximation of the underlying genetics -
              namely, many loci, each making a small contribution to the total
              variance. As Barton et al. (2017) show, in the limit as the
              number of loci increases (with enough additivity), the
              distribution of genotypic values for descendants approaches a
              multivariate Gaussian, whose variance-covariance structure
              depends only on the relatedness, not the phenotypes, of the
              parents (or whether their population experiences selection or
              other processes such as mutation and migration). Barton et al.
              (2017) call this rigorously defensible ``Gaussian descendants''
              approximation ``the infinitesimal model.'' However, it is widely
              assumed that Fisher's genetic assumptions yield another Gaussian
              approximation, in which the distribution of breeding values in a
              population follows a Gaussian - even if the population is subject
              to non-Gaussian selection. This third ``Gaussian population''
              approximation, is also described as the ``infinitesimal model.''
              Unlike the ``Gaussian descendants'' approximation, this third
              approximation cannot be rigorously justified, except in a
              weak-selection limit, even for a purely additive model.
              Nevertheless, it underlies the two most widely used descriptions
              of selection-induced changes in trait means and genetic
              variances, the ``breeder's equation'' and the ``Bulmer effect.''
              Future generations may understand why the ``infinitesimal model''
              provides such useful approximations in the face of epistasis,
              linkage, linkage disequilibrium and strong selection.",

  abstract  = "Selection on one or more genes inevitably perturbs other genes,
               even when those genes have no direct effect on fitness. This
               article reviews the theory of such genetic hitchhiking,
               concentrating on effects on neutral loci. Maynard Smith and
               Haigh introduced the classical case where the perturbation is
               due to a single favourable mutation. This is contrasted with the
               apparently distinct effects of inherited variation in fitness
               due to loosely linked loci. A model of fluctuating selection is
               analysed which bridges these alternative treatments. When
               alleles sweep between extreme frequencies at a rate lambda, the
               rate of drift is increased by a factor (1 +
               E[1/pq]lambda/(2(2lambda + r))), where the recombination rate r
               is much smaller than the strength of selection. In spatially
               structured populations, the effects of any one substitution are
               weaker, and only cause a local increase in the frequency of a
               neutral allele. This increase depends primarily on the rate of
               recombination relative to selection (r/s), and more weakly, on
               the neighbourhood size, Nb = 4(pi rho sigma)2. Spatial
               subdivision may allow local selective sweeps to occur more
               frequently than is indicated by the overall rate of molecular
               evolution. However, it seems unlikely that such sweeps can be

               genetics is the profound effect that natural selection on one
               locus can have on genetic variation patterns at linked loci.
               Since the first evidence for linked selection was uncovered in
               Drosophila melanogaster over two decades ago, substantial effort
               has focused on quantifying the effects and on distinguishing the
               relative contributions of purifying and positive selection. We
               introduce an approach to jointly model the effects of positive
               and negative selection along the genome and infer selection
               parameters. To this end, we consider how closely linked each
               neutral site is to different types of annotations and
               substitutions. When we apply the inference method to genome-wide
               data from 125 D. melanogaster lines, our model explains most of
               the variance in diversity levels at the megabase scale and
               allows us to distinguish among the contribution of different
               modes of selection on proteins and UTRs. More generally, we
               provide a map of the effects of natural selection along the
               genome, and show that selection at linked sites has had an even
               more drastic effect on diversity patterns than previously
               appreciated. We also make a tool available to apply this

               parents. The predictive value of the formulae is tested under a
               model of truncation selection with the infinitesimal model of
               gene effects, where C2 and G are a function of the selection
               intensity, the heritability and the intraclass correlation of
               sibs. Under random mating r = alpha I = -1/(N - 1) and alpha O =
               0. Under partial full-sib mating with an average proportion beta
               of full-sib matings per generation, r approximately beta and
               alpha O approximately alpha I approximately beta/(4 - 3 beta).
               The prediction equation is compared to other approximations
               based on the long-term contributions of ancestors to
               descendants. Finally, based on the approach followed, a system
               of mating (compensatory mating) is proposed to reduce rates of
               inbreeding without loss of response in selection programs in
               which selected individuals from the largest families are mated
               to those from the smallest families.",

               treatments of this method have adopted rather limiting

               is generally applicable to a wide variety of organisms. Use of a

               reproduction) whose differences have been stressed by previous
               authors can be treated in a uniform way. Computer simulations

               spread of beneficial mutations (selective sweeps) or the
               response of many quantitative trait loci drive adaptation to
               environmental changes. Although much attention has been given to
               the genomic footprint of selective sweeps, the importance of
               selection on quantitative traits is still not well studied, as
               the associated genomic signature is extremely difficult to
               detect. We propose 'Evolve and Resequence' as a promising tool,
               to study polygenic adaptation of quantitative traits in evolving
               populations. Simulating replicated time series data we show that
               adaptation to a new intermediate trait optimum has three
               characteristic phases that are reflected on the genomic level:
               (1) directional frequency changes towards the new trait optimum,
               (2) plateauing of allele frequencies when the new trait optimum
               has been reached and (3) subsequent divergence between
               replicated trajectories ultimately leading to the loss or
               fixation of alleles while the trait value does not change. We
               explore these 3 phase characteristics for relevant population
               genetic parameters to provide expectations for various
               experimental evolution designs. Remarkably, over a broad range
               of parameters the trajectories of selected alleles display a
               pattern across replicates, which differs both from neutrality
               and directional selection. We conclude that replicated time
               series data from experimental evolution studies provide a
               promising framework to study polygenic adaptation from
               whole-genome population genetics data.",

  author    = "Coop, Graham and Ralph, Peter",
  abstract  = "Two major sources of stochasticity in the dynamics of neutral
               alleles result from resampling of finite populations (genetic
               drift) and the random genetic background of nearby selected
               alleles on which the neutral alleles are found (linked
               selection). There is now good evidence that linked selection
               plays an important role in shaping polymorphism levels in a
               number of species. One of the best-investigated models of linked
               selection is the recurrent full-sweep model, in which newly
               arisen selected alleles fix rapidly. However, the bulk of
               selected alleles that sweep into the population may not be
               destined for rapid fixation. Here we develop a general model of
               recurrent selective sweeps in a coalescent framework, one that
               generalizes the recurrent full-sweep model to the case where
               selected alleles do not sweep to fixation. We show that in a
               large population, only the initial rapid increase of a selected
               allele affects the genealogy at partially linked sites, which
               under fairly general assumptions are unaffected by the
               subsequent fate of the selected allele. We also apply the theory
               to a simple model to investigate the impact of recurrent partial
               sweeps on levels of neutral diversity and find that for a given
               reduction in diversity, the impact of recurrent partial sweeps
               on the frequency spectrum at neutral sites is determined
               primarily by the frequencies rapidly achieved by the selected
               alleles. Consequently, recurrent sweeps of selected alleles to
               low frequencies can have a profound effect on levels of
               diversity but can leave the frequency spectrum relatively
               unperturbed. In fact, the limiting coalescent model under a high
               rate of sweeps to low frequency is identical to the standard
               neutral model. The general model of selective sweeps we describe
               goes some way toward providing a more flexible framework to
               describe genomic patterns of diversity than is currently
               available.",

               the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) gene on chromosome 4 of P.
               falciparum. Point mutations in dhfr are known to be responsible
               for resistance to the antimalarial drug pyrimethamine, and
               resistance to this drug has spread rapidly in Southeast (SE)
               Asia after its introduction in 1970s. We genotyped 33
               microsatellite markers distributed across chromosome 4 in 61
               parasites from a location on the Thailand/Myanmar border. We
               observed minimal microsatellite length variation in a 12-kb
               (0.7-cM) region flanking the dhfr gene and diminished variation
               for approximately 100 kb (6 cM), indicative of a single origin
               of resistant alleles. Furthermore, we found the same or similar
               microsatellite haplotypes flanked resistant dhfr alleles sampled
               from 11 parasite populations in five SE Asian countries
               indicating recent invasion of a single lineage of resistant dhfr
               alleles in locations 2000 km apart. Three features of these data
               are of especially interest. (1). Pyrimethamine resistance is
               generally assumed to have evolved multiple times because the
               genetic basis is simple and resistance can be selected easily in
               the laboratory. Yet our data clearly indicate a single origin of
               resistant dhfr alleles sampled over a large region of SE Asia.
               (2). The wide valley ( approximately 6 cM) of reduced variation
               around dhfr provides ``proof-of-principle'' that genome-wide
               association may be an effective way to locate genes under strong
               recent selection. (3). The width of the selective valley is
               consistent with predictions based on independent measures of
               recombination, mutation, and selection intensity, suggesting
               that we have reasonable estimates of these parameters. We
               conclude that scanning the malaria parasite genome for evidence
               of recent selection may prove an extremely effective way to
               locate genes underlying recently evolved traits such as drug
               resistance, as well as providing an opportunity to study the
               dynamics of selective events that have occurred recently or are
