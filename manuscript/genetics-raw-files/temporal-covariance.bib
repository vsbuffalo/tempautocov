  title     = "Evolution of life in urban environments",
  author    = "Johnson, Marc T J and Munshi-South, Jason",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND The extent of urban areas is increasing around the
               world, and most humans now live in cities. Urbanization results
               in dramatic environmental change, including increased
               temperatures, more impervious surface cover, altered hydrology,
               and elevated pollution. Urban areas also host more non-native
               species and reduced abundance and diversity of many native
               species. These environmental changes brought by global
               urbanization are creating novel ecosystems with unknown
               consequences for the evolution of life. Here, we consider how
               early human settlements led to the evolution of human
               commensals, including some of the most notorious pests and
               disease vectors. We also comprehensively review how contemporary
               urbanization affects the evolution of species that coinhabit
               cities.ADVANCES A recent surge of research shows that
               urbanization affects both nonadaptive and adaptive evolution.
               Some of the clearest results of urban evolution show that cities
               elevate the strength of random genetic drift (stochastic changes
               in allele frequencies) and restrict gene flow (the movement of
               alleles between populations due to dispersal and mating).
               Populations of native species in cities often represent either
               relicts that predate urbanization or populations that
               established after a city formed. Both scenarios frequently
               result in a loss of genetic diversity within populations and
               increased differentiation between populations. Fragmentation and
               urban infrastructure also create barriers to dispersal, and
               consequently, gene flow is often reduced among city populations,
               which further contributes to genetic differentiation between
               populations.The influence of urbanization on mutation and
               adaptive evolution are less clear. A small number of studies
               suggest that industrial pollution can elevate mutation rates,
               but the pervasiveness of this effect is unknown. A better
               studied phenomenon are the effects of urbanization on evolution
               by natural selection. A growing number of studies show that
               plant and animal populations experience divergent selection
               between urban and nonurban environments. This divergent
               selection has led to adaptive evolution in life history,
               morphology, physiology, behavior, and reproductive traits. These
               adaptations typically evolve in response to pesticide use,
               pollution, local climate, or the physical structure of cities.
               Despite these important results, the genetic basis of adaptive
               evolution is known from only a few cases. Most studies also
               examine only a few populations in one city, and experimental
               validation is rare.OUTLOOK The study of evolution in urban areas
               provides insights into both fundamental and applied problems in
               biology. The thousands of cities throughout the world share some
               features while differing in other aspects related to their age,
               historical context, governmental policies, and local climate.
               Thus, the phenomenon of global urbanization represents an
               unintended but highly replicated global study of experimental
               evolution. We can harness this global urban experiment to
               understand the repeatability and pace of evolution in response
               to human activity. Among the most important unresolved questions
               is, how often do native and exotic species adapt to the
               particular environmental challenges found in cities? Such
               adaptations could be the difference as to whether a species
               persists or vanishes from urban areas. In this way, the study of
               urban evolution can help us understand how evolution in
               populations may contribute to conservation of rare species, and
               how populations can be managed to facilitate the establishment
               of resilient and sustainable urban ecosystems. In a similar way,
               understanding evolution in urban areas can lead to improved
               human health. For example, human pests frequently adapt to
               pesticides and evade control efforts because of our limited
               understanding of the size of populations and movement of
               individuals. Applied evolutionary studies could lead to more
               effective mitigation of pests and disease agents. The study of
               urban evolution has rapidly become an important frontier in
               biology, with implications for healthy and sustainable human
               populations in urban ecosystems.",

  title    = "Statistical aspects of evolution under natural selection, with
              implications for the advantage of sexual reproduction",
  author   = "Crouch, Daniel J M",
  abstract = "The prevalence of sexual reproduction remains mysterious, as it
              poses clear evolutionary drawbacks compared to reproducing
              asexually. Several possible explanations exist, with one of the
              most likely being that finite population size causes linkage
              disequilibria to randomly generate and impede the progress of
              natural selection, and that these are eroded by recombination via
              sexual reproduction. Previous investigations have either analysed
              this phenomenon in detail for small numbers of loci, or performed
              population simulations for many loci. Here we present a
              quantitative genetic model for fitness, based on the Price
              Equation, in order to examine the theoretical consequences of
              randomly generated linkage disequilibria when there are many
              loci. In addition, most previous work has been concerned with the
              long-term consequences of deleterious linkage disequilibria for
              population fitness. The expected change in mean fitness between
              consecutive generations, a measure of short-term evolutionary
              success, is shown under random environmental influences to be
              related to the autocovariance in mean fitness between the
              generations, capturing the effects of stochastic forces such as
              genetic drift. Interaction between genetic drift and natural
              selection, due to randomly generated linkage disequilibria, is
              demonstrated to be one possible source of mean fitness
              autocovariance. This suggests a possible role for sexual
              reproduction in reducing the negative effects of genetic drift,
              thereby improving the short-term efficacy of natural selection.",

  author   = "Hallatschek, Oskar and Nelson, David R",
  abstract = "Large scale genomic surveys are partly motivated by the idea that
              the neutral genetic variation of a population may be used to
              reconstruct its migration history. However, our ability to trace
              back the colonization pathways of a species from their genetic
              footprints is limited by our understanding of the genetic
              consequences of a range expansion. Here, we study, by means of
              simulations and analytical methods, the neutral dynamics of gene
              frequencies in an asexual population undergoing a continual range
              expansion in one dimension. During such a colonization period,
              lineages can fix at the wave front by means of a ``surfing''
              mechanism [Edmonds, C.A., Lillie, A.S., Cavalli-Sforza, L.L.,
              2004. Mutations arising in the wave front of an expanding
              population. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 101, 975-979]. We quantify
              this phenomenon in terms of (i) the spatial distribution of
              lineages that reach fixation and, closely related, (ii) the
              continual loss of genetic diversity (heterozygosity) at the wave
              front, characterizing the approach to fixation. Our stochastic
              simulations show that an effective population size can be
              assigned to the wave that controls the (observable) gradient in
              heterozygosity left behind the colonization process. This
              effective population size is markedly higher in the presence of
              cooperation between individuals (``pushed waves'') than when
              individuals proliferate independently (``pulled waves''), and
              increases only sub-linearly with deme size. To explain these and
              other findings, we develop a versatile analytical approach, based
              on the physics of reaction-diffusion systems, that yields simple
              predictions for any deterministic population dynamics. Our
              analytical theory compares well with the simulation results for
              pushed waves, but is less accurate in the case of pulled waves
              when stochastic fluctuations in the tip of the wave are
              important.",

               derives from a single mutational origin. This ignores that

               mutation or migration, during the selective phase. In this case,
               descendants of several of these independent origins may
               contribute to the fixation. As a consequence, all ancestral

               retained in the population, affecting the pattern of a selective

               patterns are different when adaptation responds quickly to a
               novel selection pressure, acting either on standing genetic

  abstract = "Begun and Aquadro have demonstrated that levels of nucleotide
              variation correlate with recombination rate among 20 gene regions
              from across the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. It has been
              suggested that this correlation results from genetic hitchhiking
              associated with the fixation of strongly selected mutants. The
              hitchhiking process can be described as a series of two-step
              events. The first step consists of a strongly selected
              substitution wiping out linked variation in a population; this is
              followed by a recovery period in which polymorphism can build up
              via neutral mutations and random genetic drift. Genetic
              hitchhiking has previously been modeled as a steady-state process
              driven by recurring selected substitutions. We show here that the
              characteristic parameter of this steady-state model is alpha v,
              the product of selection intensity (alpha = 2Ns) and the
              frequency of beneficial mutations v (where N is population size
              and s is the selective advantage of the favored allele). We also
              demonstrate that the steady-state model describes the hitchhiking
              process adequately, unless the recombination rate is very low. To
              estimate alpha v, we use the data of DNA sequence variation from
              17 D. melanogaster loci from regions of intermediate to high
              recombination rates. We find that alpha v is likely to be > 1.3 x

              more precisely. The estimation of alpha v is important, as this

  abstract = "Large populations may contain numerous simultaneously segregating
              polymorphisms subject to natural selection. Since selection acts
              on individuals whose fitness depends on many loci, different loci
              affect each other's dynamics. This leads to stochastic
              fluctuations of allele frequencies above and beyond genetic
              drift-an effect known as genetic draft. Since recombination
              disrupts associations between alleles, draft is strong when
              recombination is rare. Here, we study a facultatively outcrossing
              population in a regime where the frequency of outcrossing and
              recombination, r, is small compared to the characteristic scale
              of fitness differences $\sigma$. In this regime, fit genotypes
              expand clonally, leading to large fluctuations in the number of
              recombinant offspring genotypes. The power law tail in the
              distribution of the latter makes it impossible to capture the
              dynamics of draft by an effective neutral model. Instead, we find
              that the fixation time of a neutral allele increases only slowly
              with the population size but depends sensitively on the ratio
              r/$\sigma$. The efficacy of selection is reduced dramatically and

              weakly on population size N. In addition, the anomalous

              alleles from f($\nu$) ∼ $\nu$(-1), corresponding to drift, to ∼

              not yet been resolved: it is not clear to what extent the spread
              of beneficial mutations (selective sweeps) or the response of
              many quantitative trait loci drive adaptation to environmental
              changes. Although much attention has been given to the genomic
              footprint of selective sweeps, the importance of selection on
              quantitative traits is still not well studied, as the associated
              genomic signature is extremely difficult to detect. We propose
              'Evolve and Resequence' as a promising tool, to study polygenic
              adaptation of quantitative traits in evolving populations.
              Simulating replicated time series data we show that adaptation to
              a new intermediate trait optimum has three characteristic phases
              that are reflected on the genomic level: (1) directional
              frequency changes towards the new trait optimum, (2) plateauing
              of allele frequencies when the new trait optimum has been reached
              and (3) subsequent divergence between replicated trajectories
              ultimately leading to the loss or fixation of alleles while the
              trait value does not change. We explore these 3 phase
              characteristics for relevant population genetic parameters to
              provide expectations for various experimental evolution designs.
              Remarkably, over a broad range of parameters the trajectories of
              selected alleles display a pattern across replicates, which
              differs both from neutrality and directional selection. We
              conclude that replicated time series data from experimental
              evolution studies provide a promising framework to study

               not change with age, such as meristic traits or adult characters
               in species with determinate growth. Ontogenetic characters,

               longitudinal studies where individuals are followed through
               time. Following an approach pioneered by Pearson (1903), this

               quantify its intensity, without identifying the selective
               agent(s). By accounting for indirect selection through

              deterministic. In the first half of the selected phase after a
              favored mutation has entered the population, hitchhiking may lead
              to a strong increase of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the
              two neutral sites if both are 0.3 s), the decay rate of LD
              approaches that of neutrality. Averaging over a uniform
              distribution of initial gamete frequencies shows that the
              expected LD at the end of the hitchhiking phase is driven toward
              zero, while the variance is increased when the selected site is
              well outside the two neutral sites. When the direction of LD is

              Here we analyse the dynamics of molecular evolution in twelve

  abstract = "The observation that traits closely related to fitness (``fitness
              traits'') have lower heritabilities than traits more distantly
              associated with fitness has traditionally been framed in terms of
              Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection-fitness traits
              are expected to have low levels of additive genetic variance due
              to rapid fixation of alleles conferring highest fitness.
              Subsequent treatments have challenged this view by pointing out
              that high environmental and nonadditive genetic contributions to
              phenotypic variation may also explain the low heritability of
              fitness traits. Analysis of a large data set from the collared
              flycatcher Ficedula albicollis confirmed a previous finding that
              traits closely associated with fitness tend to have lower
              heritability. However, analysis of coefficients of additive
              genetic variation (CVA) revealed that traits closely associated
              with fitness had higher levels of additive genetic variation (VA)
              than traits more distantly associated with fitness. Hence, the
              negative relationship between a trait's association with fitness
              and its heritability was not due to lower levels of VA in fitness
              traits but was due to their higher residual variance. However,
              whether the high residual variance was mainly due to higher
              levels of environmental variance or due to higher levels of
              nonadditive genetic variance remains a challenge to be addressed
              by further studies. Our results are consistent with earlier

              evolutionary stasis in most populations remains an unresolved
              question in evolutionary biology. Climate has been hypothesized
              to drive reversals in the direction of selection among different
              time periods and may also be responsible for intense episodic
              selection caused by rare weather events. We measured viability
              selection associated with morphological traits in cliff swallows
              (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) in western Nebraska, USA, over a
              14-year period following a rare climatic event. We used
              mark-recapture to estimate the annual apparent survival of over
              26 000 individuals whose wing, tail, tarsus and bill had been
              measured. The fitness functions associated with tarsus length and
              bill dimensions fluctuated depending on annual climate conditions

              trait trajectories, although there was a trend over time for all

              directional selection on some traits, despite periodic

              morphology in the population is likely to keep changing and

  abstract  = "Seasonal selection acting on the melanic polymorphism in the
               two-spot ladybird Adalia bipunctata was investigated in The
               Netherlands. An increase in melanic frequency over the
               spring-summer reproductive period was quantified. The selective
               advantage gained by melanics averaged 9\%, but significant
               heterogeneity occurred between populations. Adult hibernation
               behaviour is described. The beetles when outdoors show a highly
               clumped distribution both between and within trees. The
               distribution of the morph classes between aggregations is
               random. Survivorship in a hibernating cohort (initial n= 1898)
               on a grid of 70 lime trees near Utrecht was monitored by making
               three counts over the winter of 1981--1982. Intense selection
               favouring each melanic morph occurred during December and
               January. The relative fitness of non-melanics was 0.55 (melanics
               =1). The discovery of dead beetles in late January (about 5\% of
               total losses) and the absence of spatially density-dependent
               mortality were consistent with a climatic stress rather than
               selective predation. The period of selection was associated with
               very cold temperatures averaging up to 4°C below normal and an
               overall mortality of nearly 75\%. There was no change in morph
               frequency, near normal temperatures and a lower mortality from
               February to early April. Examination of groups of nearby trees
               in late January strongly suggested that similar differential
               mortality had occurred except on some willows. This difference
               was probably due to the more protected hibernation sites
               available on these trees. Samples of hibernating cohorts at
               three other sites showed no evidence of differential mortality.
               Laboratory experiments with hibernating beetles found no
               difference in survivorship or rate of weight loss between
               starved non-melanics and melanics in temperature regimes with
               and without periods of adult activity. It is concluded that the
               intense winter selection on the study limes is probably
               exceptional. Examination of changes in morph frequency through
               the annual cycle suggests that at some sites the selection
               favouring melanics during reproduction is counterbalanced by
               selection against melanics in late summer or early autumn. The
               results are discussed in relation to mathematical models of
               cyclical selection and to other field studies including that of
               Timof{\'e}eff-Ressovsky (1940), who found large decreases in

              been studied in the laboratory, but relatively little is known of
              fitness variation in natural environments or its causes. Lifetime
              fitness (recruitment) may be determined solely by producing many
              offspring, modified by stochastic effects on their subsequent
              survival up to the point of breeding, or by an additional
              contribution made by the high quality of the offspring owing to
              nonrandom mate choice. To investigate the determinants of
              lifetime fitness, we measured offspring production, longevity,
              and lifetime number of mates in four cohorts of two long-lived
              species of socially monogamous Darwin's finch species, Geospiza
              fortis and G. scandens, on the equatorial Gal{\'a}pagos Island of
              Daphne Major. Regression analysis showed that the lifetime
              production of fledglings was predicted by lifetime number of
              clutches and that recruitment was predicted by lifetime number of
              fledglings and longevity. There was little support for a

              extrapair mates were no more fit in terms of recruitment than

              insight into the evolution of life history strategies of tropical
              birds. Darwin's finches deviate from the standard tropical
              pattern of a slow pace of life by combining tropical (long
              lifespan) and temperate (large clutch size) characteristics. Our
              study of fitness shows why this is so in terms of selective
              pressures (fledgling production and adult longevity) and
              ecological opportunities (pulsed food supply and relatively low

              the observed allele frequency changes and, therefore, another
              factor must be invoked: cultural transmission of fitness (CTF).
              CTF is the non-genetic transmission of any kind of behaviour that
              affects reproductive success. There are several clearly
              documented examples of CTF, and theoretical studies have shown

              about the prevalence and strength of adaptation. Specifically, we
              develop a coalescent-based model for the shape of the entire
              curve and use it to infer adaptive parameters by maximum
              likelihood. Our inference suggests that ∼13\% of amino acid
              substitutions cause selective sweeps. Interestingly, it reveals
              two classes of beneficial fixations: a minority (approximately
              3\%) that appears to have had large selective effects and
              accounts for most of the reduction in diversity, and the
              remaining 10\%, which seem to have had very weak selective
              effects. These estimates therefore help to reconcile the apparent
              conflict among previously published estimates of the strength of
              selection. More generally, our findings provide unequivocal
              evidence for strongly beneficial substitutions in Drosophila and
              illustrate how the rapidly accumulating genome-wide data can be
              leveraged to address enduring questions about the genetic basis

               generates negative linkage disequilibrium, on average, even if
               selection acts independently (i.e., multiplicatively) upon all
               loci. Negative disequilibrium reduces the variance in fitness
               and hence, by Fisher's (1930) fundamental theorem, slows the
               rate of increase in mean fitness. Modifiers that increase
               recombination eliminate the negative disequilibria that impede
               selection and consequently increase in frequency by
               ``hitchhiking.'' Thus, stochastic fluctuations in linkage
               disequilibrium in finite populations favor the evolution of
               increased rates of recombination, even in the absence of
               epistatic interactions among loci and even when disequilibrium

               modifier allele that increases recombination in a finite

               linkage disequilibria do select for increased recombination, a
               result that is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations. Selection
               for a modifier that increases recombination is highest when
               linkage among loci is tight, when beneficial alleles rise from

               Prediction of rates of adaptation, in the sense of change in
               mean fitness, into the future would, however, valuably inform
               expectations for persistence of populations, especially in our
               era of rapid environmental change. Heavy investment in genomics
               and other molecular tools has fueled belief that those
               approaches can effectively predict adaptation into the future. I
               contest this view. Genome scans display the genomic footprints
               of the effects of natural selection and the other evolutionary
               processes over past generations, but it remains problematic to
               predict future change in mean fitness via genomic approaches.
               Here, I advocate for a direct approach to prediction of rates of
               ongoing adaptation. Following an overview of relevant
               quantitative genetic approaches, I outline the promise of the
               fundamental theorem of natural selection for the study of the

               these have been applied to a large variety of species and

               assumption of a single isolated population receiving no

               substantially bias estimates of N(e) if it is not accounted for.
               Here we extend previous moment and maximum-likelihood methods to

               at least one recombination event among the loci involved.
               Finally, higher order disequilibria among loci will be lower

               has resulted in an explosion in efforts to infer the demographic
               histories of natural populations across a broad range of
               organisms. As demographic events alter coalescent genealogies,
               they leave detectable signatures in patterns of genetic
               variation within and between populations. Accordingly, a variety
               of approaches have been designed to leverage population genetic
               data to uncover the footprints of demographic change in the
               genome. The vast majority of these methods make the simplifying
               assumption that the measures of genetic variation used as their
               input are unaffected by natural selection. However, natural
               selection can dramatically skew patterns of variation not only
               at selected sites, but at linked, neutral loci as well. Here we
               assess the impact of recent positive selection on demographic
               inference by characterizing the performance of three popular
               methods through extensive simulation of data sets with varying
               numbers of linked selective sweeps. In particular, we examined
               three different demographic models relevant to a number of
               species, finding that positive selection can bias parameter
               estimates of each of these models-often severely. We find that
               selection can lead to incorrect inferences of population size
               changes when none have occurred. Moreover, we show that linked
               selection can lead to incorrect demographic model selection,

               natural populations may experience the amount of recent positive

               that demographic studies conducted in many species to date may

              genetic variation at linked sites. Thus, in principle,
              adaptations can be mapped by looking for the signature of
              directional selection in polymorphism data. In practice, such
              efforts are hampered by the need for an accurate characterization
              of the demographic history of the species and of the effects of
              positive selection. In an attempt to circumvent these
              difficulties, researchers are increasingly taking a purely
              empirical approach, in which a large number of genomic regions
              are ordered by summaries of the polymorphism data, and loci with
              extreme values are considered to be likely targets of positive
              selection. We evaluated the reliability of the ``empirical''
              approach, focusing on applications to human data and to maize. To
              do so, we considered a coalescent model of directional selection
              in a sensible demographic setting, allowing for selection on
              standing variation as well as on a new mutation. Our simulations
              suggest that while empirical approaches will identify several
              interesting candidates, they will also miss many--in some cases,
              most--loci of interest. The extent of the trade-off depends on
              the mode of positive selection and the demographic history of the
              population. Specifically, the false-discovery rate is higher when
              directional selection involves a recessive rather than a
              co-dominant allele, when it acts on a previously neutral rather
              than a new allele, and when the population has experienced a
              population bottleneck rather than maintained a constant size. One
              implication of these results is that, insofar as attributes of
              the beneficial mutation (e.g., the dominance coefficient) affect
              the power to detect targets of selection, genomic scans will
              yield an unrepresentative subset of loci that contribute to
              adaptations.",

  abstract  = "Adaptation in eukaryotes is generally assumed to be
               mutation-limited because of small effective population sizes.
               This view is difficult to reconcile, however, with the
               observation that adaptation to anthropogenic changes, such as
               the introduction of pesticides, can occur very rapidly. Here we
               investigate adaptation at a key insecticide resistance locus
               (Ace) in Drosophila melanogaster and show that multiple simple
               and complex resistance alleles evolved quickly and repeatedly
               within individual populations. Our results imply that the
               current effective population size of modern D. melanogaster
               populations is likely to be substantially larger (> or =
               100-fold) than commonly believed. This discrepancy arises
               because estimates of the effective population size are generally
               derived from levels of standing variation and thus reveal
               long-term population dynamics dominated by sharp--even if
               infrequent--bottlenecks. The short-term effective population
               sizes relevant for strong adaptation, on the other hand, might
               be much closer to census population sizes. Adaptation in
               Drosophila may therefore not be limited by waiting for mutations
               at single sites, and complex adaptive alleles can be generated
               quickly without fixation of intermediate states. Adaptive events
               should also commonly involve the simultaneous rise in frequency
               of independently generated adaptive mutations. These so-called
               soft sweeps have very distinct effects on the linked neutral
               polymorphisms compared to the standard hard sweeps in
               mutation-limited scenarios. Methods for the mapping of adaptive

               populations to synthesize what we do (and do not) know about the

               the strength of selection often varies considerably from year to
               year, although random sampling error of selection coefficients
               may impose bias in estimates of the magnitude of such variation.

               Third, changes in the form of selection are likely common, but
               harder to quantify. Although few studies have identified causal
               mechanisms underlying temporal variation in the strength,
               direction and form of selection, variation in environmental

              fluctuating selection could potentially make a large contribution
              to maintaining genetic polymorphism in populations. However,
              previous theory suggests that the conditions for multilocus
              polymorphism are restrictive. Here, we explore a more general
              class of models with multilocus seasonally fluctuating selection
              in diploids. In these models, the multilocus genotype is mapped
              to fitness in two steps. The first mapping is additive across
              loci and accounts for the relative contributions of heterozygous
              and homozygous loci-that is, dominance. The second step uses a
              nonlinear fitness function to account for the strength of
              selection and epistasis. Using mathematical analysis and
              individual-based simulations, we show that stable polymorphism at
              many loci is possible if currently favored alleles are
              sufficiently dominant. This general mechanism, which we call
              ``segregation lift,'' requires seasonal changes in dominance, a
              phenomenon that may arise naturally in situations with
              antagonistic pleiotropy and seasonal changes in the relative
              importance of traits for fitness. Segregation lift works best
              under diminishing-returns epistasis, is not affected by problems
              of genetic load, and is robust to differences in parameters
              across loci and seasons. Under segregation lift, loci can exhibit
              conspicuous seasonal allele-frequency fluctuations, but often
              fluctuations may be small and hard to detect. An important
              direction for future work is to formally test for segregation

  abstract = "Abstract Recent studies have documented rates of evolution of
              ecologically important phenotypes sufficiently fast that they
              have the potential to impact the outcome of ecological
              interactions while they are underway. Observations of this type
              go against accepted wisdom that ecological and evolutionary
              dynamics occur at very different time scales. While some authors
              have evaluated the rapidity of a measured evolutionary rate by
              comparing it to the overall distribution of measured evolutionary
              rates, we believe that ecologists are mainly interested in rapid
              evolution because of its potential to impinge on ecological
              processes. We therefore propose that rapid evolution be defined
              as a genetic change occurring rapidly enough to have a measurable
              impact on simultaneous ecological change. Using this definition
              we propose a framework for decomposing rates of ecological change
              into components driven by simultaneous evolutionary change and by
              change in a non-evolutionary factor (e.g. density dependent
              population dynamics, abiotic environmental change). Evolution is
              judged to be rapid in this ecological context if its contribution
              to ecological change is large relative to the contribution of
              other factors. We provide a worked example of this approach based
              on a theoretical predator?prey interaction [Abrams, P. \&
              Matsuda, H. (1997). Evolution, 51, 1740], and find that in this
              system the impact of prey evolution on predator per capita growth
              rate is 63\% that of internal ecological dynamics. We then
              propose analytical methods for measuring these contributions in
              field situations, and apply them to two long-term data sets for
              which suitable ecological and evolutionary data exist. For both
              data sets relatively high rates of evolutionary change have been
              found when measured as character change in standard deviations
              per generation (haldanes). For Darwin's finches evolving in
              response to fluctuating rainfall [Grant, P.R. \& Grant, B.R.
              (2002). Science, 296, 707], we estimate that evolutionary change
              has been more rapid than ecological change by a factor of 2.2.
              For a population of freshwater copepods whose life history
              evolves in response to fluctuating fish predation [Hairston, N.G.
              Jr \& Dillon, T.A. (1990). Evolution, 44, 1796], we find that
              evolutionary change has been about one quarter the rate of
              ecological change ? less than in the finch example, but
              nevertheless substantial. These analyses support the view that in
              order to understand temporal dynamics in ecological processes it
              is critical to consider the extent to which the attributes of the
              system under investigation are simultaneously changing as a

  abstract = "We compiled a database of microevolution on contemporary time
              scales in nature (47 source articles; 30 animal species),
              comprising 2649 evolutionary rates in darwins (proportional
              change per million years) and 2151 evolutionary rates in haldanes
              (standard deviations per generation). Here we demonstrate how
              quantitative rate measures can provide general insights into
              patterns and processes of evolution. The frequency distribution
              of evolutionary rates was approximately log-normal, with many
              slow rates and few fast rates. Net selection intensities
              estimated from haldanes were on average lower than selection
              intensities commonly measured directly in natural populations.
              This difference suggests that natural selection could easily
              accomplish observed microevolution but that the intensities of
              selection typically measured in nature are rarely maintained for
              long (otherwise observed evolutionary rates would be higher).
              Traits closely associated with fitness (life history traits)
              appear to evolve at least as fast as traits less closely tied to
              fitness (morphology). The magnitude of evolutionary difference
              increased with the length of the time interval, particularly when
              maximum rates from a given study were considered. This pattern
              suggests a general underlying tendency toward increasing
              evolutionary diversification with time. However, evolutionary
              rates also tended to decrease with time, perhaps because longer
              time intervals average increasingly disparate rates over time, or
              because evolution slows when populations approach new optima or
              as genetic variation is depleted. In combination, our results
              suggest that macroevolutionary transitions may ultimately arise
              through microevolution occasionally 'writ large' but are perhaps
              temporally characterized by microevolution 'writ in fits and
              starts'.",

              human-disturbed (anthropogenic) contexts are greater than those
              associated with more 'natural' contexts. Our meta-analysis is
              based on more than 3000 rates of phenotypic change in 68
              'systems', each representing a given species in a particular

              difference may be influenced by phenotypic plasticity - because
              it was evident for studies of wild-caught individuals (which

              common-garden or quantitative genetic studies (which minimize

              response to disturbance can be remarkably abrupt, perhaps again

              Specifically, we consider the evolution of a polygenic trait that
              is under stabilizing selection with a moving optimum. The
              ecological dynamics are defined by the strength of selection,
              sigma, and the speed of the optimum, v; the key genetic
              parameters are the mutation rate Theta and the variance of the
              effects of new mutations, omega. We develop analytical
              approximations within an ``adaptive-walk'' framework and describe
              how selection acts as a sieve that transforms a given
              distribution of new mutations into the distribution of adaptive
              substitutions. Our analytical results are complemented by
              individual-based simulations. We find that (i) the ecological
              dynamics have a strong effect on the distribution of adaptive
              substitutions and their impact depends largely on a single
              composite measure gamma=v/(sigmaThetaomega(3)), which combines
              the ecological and genetic parameters; (ii) depending on gamma,
              we can distinguish two distinct adaptive regimes: for large gamma
              the adaptive process is mutation limited and dominated by genetic
              constraints, whereas for small gamma it is environmentally
              limited and dominated by the external ecological dynamics; (iii)

              increases over time at a constant rate. We first analyze a
              one-locus two-allele model with recurrent mutation, for which we
              derive accurate analytical approximations for (i) the time at
              which a previously deleterious allele becomes beneficial, (ii)
              the waiting time for a successful new mutation, and (iii) the
              time the mutant allele needs to reach fixation. On the basis of
              these results, we show that the shortest total time to fixation
              is for alleles with intermediate phenotypic effect. We derive an
              approximation for this ``optimal'' effect, and we show that it
              depends in a simple way on a composite parameter, which
              integrates the ecological parameters and the genetic architecture

              simulations of a multilocus model to study the order in which

              agreement with the one-locus results, alleles with intermediate

              or large effects. However, the effect size of the fastest
              mutations differs from the one predicted in the one-locus model.
              We show how these differences can be explained by two specific

              Balancing selection has been proposed as a mechanism that could

              rates of recombination. For example, near centromeres and near
              the tips of chromosomes, the rates of recombination are much
              lower than in other regions. Several surveys of polymorphisms in
              Drosophila have now documented that levels of DNA polymorphism
              are positively correlated with rates of recombination; i.e.,
              regions with low rates of recombination tend to have low levels
              of DNA polymorphism within populations of Drosophila. Three
              hypotheses are reviewed that might account for these
              observations. The first hypothesis is that regions of low
              recombination have low neutral mutation rates. Under this
              hypothesis between-species divergences should also be low in
              regions of low recombination. In fact, regions of low
              recombination have diverged at the same rate as other regions of
              the genome. On this basis, this strictly neutral hypothesis is
              rejected. The second hypothesis is that the process of fixation
              of favorable mutations leads to the observed correlation between
              polymorphism and recombination. This occurs via genetic
              hitchhiking, in which linked regions of the genome are swept
              along with the selectively favored mutant as it increases in
              frequency and eventually fixes in the population. This
              hitchhiking model with fixation of favorable mutations is
              compatible with major features of the data. By assuming this
              model is correct, one can estimate the rate of fixation of
              favorable mutations. The third hypothesis is that selection
              against continually arising deleterious mutations results in
              reduced levels of polymorphism at linked loci. Analysis of this
              background selection model shows that it can produce some
              reduction in levels of polymorphism but cannot explain some
              extreme cases that have been observed. Thus, it appears that
              hitchhiking of favorable mutations and background selection
              against deleterious mutations must be considered together to
              correctly account for the patterns of polymorphism that are

              of this trait, but despite consistent positive directional
              selection on both the phenotypic and the additive genetic
              component of body mass, the population mean phenotypic value
              declined rather than increased over time. However, the mean
              breeding value for body mass at fledging increased over time,
              presumably in response to selection. We show that the divergence
              between the response to selection observed at the levels of
              genotype and phenotype can be explained by a change in
              environmental conditions over time, that is, related both to
              increased spring temperature before breeding and elevated
              population density. Our results support the suggestion that
              measuring phenotypes may not always give a reliable impression of
              evolutionary trajectories and that understanding patterns of
              phenotypic evolution in nature requires an understanding of how
              the environment has itself changed.",

              Rapidly changing population demographics complicate this
              relationship, however. To better understand how changing
              demography impacts selection, we used whole-genome sequencing

              estimate of the demography of maize domestication, showing that
              maize was reduced to approximately 5\% the population size of
              teosinte before it experienced rapid expansion post-domestication

              Mal{\'e}cot introduced FST as a measure of structure in natural

              provided differing definitions, estimation methods, and
              interpretations beyond Wright's. While this diversity in methods
              has enabled many studies in genetics, it has also introduced
              confusion regarding how to estimate FST from available data.
              Considering this confusion, wide variation in published estimates
              of FST for pairs of HapMap populations is a cause for concern.
              These estimates changed-in some cases more than twofold-when
              comparing estimates from genotyping arrays to those from sequence
              data. Indeed, changes in FST from sequencing data might be
              expected due to population genetic factors affecting rare
              variants. While rare variants do influence the result, we show
              that this is largely through differences in estimation methods.
              Correcting for this yields estimates of FST that are much more
              concordant between sequence and genotype data. These differences
              relate to three specific issues: (1) estimating FST for a single
              SNP, (2) combining estimates of FST across multiple SNPs, and (3)
              selecting the set of SNPs used in the computation. Changes in
              each of these aspects of estimation may result in FST estimates
              that are highly divergent from one another. Here, we clarify

              human effective population size from LD data. Chromosome-specific
              effective population size was estimated for all autosomes and the
              X chromosome from estimated LD between SNP pairs <100 kb apart.
              We account for variation in recombination rate by using
              coalescent-based estimates of fine-scale recombination rate from
              one sample and correlating these with LD in an independent
              sample. Phase I of the HapMap project produced between 18 and 22
              million SNP pairs in samples from four populations: Yoruba from
              Ibadan (YRI), Nigeria; Japanese from Tokyo (JPT); Han Chinese
              from Beijing (HCB); and residents from Utah with ancestry from
              northern and western Europe (CEU). For CEU, JPT, and HCB, the
              estimate of effective population size, adjusted for SNP
              ascertainment bias, was approximately 3100, whereas the estimate
              for the YRI was approximately 7500, consistent with the
              out-of-Africa theory of ancestral human population expansion and
              concurrent bottlenecks. We show that the decay in LD over
              distance between SNPs is consistent with recent population
              growth. The estimates of N(e) are lower than previously published
              estimates based on heterozygosity, possibly because they
              represent one or more bottlenecks in human population size that

              large-effect mutations occur from a nearly equal number of new

              Large-effect mutations contribute to adaptation even when the

              to predict evolutionary responses. Most adaptive traits are
              polygenic-i.e., result from selection on a large number of
              genetic loci-but most molecularly characterized traits have a
              simple genetic basis. This discrepancy is best explained by the
              difficulty in detecting small allele frequency changes (AFCs)
              across many contributing loci. To resolve this, we use laboratory
              natural selection to detect signatures for selective sweeps and
              polygenic adaptation. We exposed 10 replicates of a Drosophila
              simulans population to a new temperature regime and uncovered a
              polygenic architecture of an adaptive trait with high genetic
              redundancy among beneficial alleles. We observed convergent
              responses for several phenotypes-e.g., fitness, metabolic rate,
              and fat content-and a strong polygenic response (99 selected
              alleles; mean s = 0.059). However, each of these selected alleles
              increased in frequency only in a subset of the evolving
              replicates. We discerned different evolutionary paradigms based

              Redundancy and quantitative trait (QT) paradigms fitted the

  author    = "Robertson, Alan",
  abstract  = "1. A mathematical theory of the culling process in dairy cattle
               has been developed. This was necessary to give a conceptual
               framework for the discussion of longevity in the dairy herd as a
               heritable character, of its genetic relationship with milk yield
               and of the effects of selection on the genetical analysis of
               yield itself.2. Culling is assumed to take place at the end of
               each lactation by truncation selection of a normally distributed
               variate (the culling variate) of which yield itself is a
               component.3. Expressions are then derived for the effect of the
               culling on various parameters of yield and for survival as a
               function of yield.4. The derivation of expressions relevant to
               progeny groups is dependent on the relative values of the
               genetic and phenotypic regressions of the culling variate on
               yield.5. Because little is known of the actual causes of
               culling, it is not permissible to predict the genetic gain in
               yield by multiplying the selection differential by the
               heritability. This is only justified if the genetic and
               phenotypic regressions of the culling variate on yield are
               equal.6. A direct estimate of the genetic gain by selection can,
               however, be obtained from the covariance for any character
               between the mean relative survival of progeny groups and their
               mean value for the character.7. The effect of culling on the
               genetic analysis of yield in later lactations is discussed, as
               is the effect of later culling on survival to later ages as a
               function of early yield. It is suggested that the regression
               coefficient of relative survival of progeny groups on heifer
               yield will be approximately linear with age whereas that of
               individuals will probably increase to a limiting value.8. The
               heritability of survival to different ages will probably pass
               through a maximum at the fourth lactation.9. Longevity itself,
               as a function of heifer yield, is the sum of the cumulative
               survival curves to each individual lactation. The regression of
               length of life on heifer yield, at the individual or at the
               progeny test level, can be related to the mean phenotypic and
               genetic selection applied to animals in the herd at any time.10.
               Because culling is to a large extent a voluntary action of the
               farmer, longevity in the dairy herd, though it is under
               continual selection and may have a significant heritability,
               need not necessarily increase.",

  abstract = "Evolutionary theory has produced two conflicting paradigms for
              the adaptation of a polygenic trait. While population genetics
              views adaptation as a sequence of selective sweeps at single loci
              underlying the trait, quantitative genetics posits a collective
              response, where phenotypic adaptation results from subtle allele
              frequency shifts at many loci. Yet, a synthesis of these views is
              largely missing and the population genetic factors that favor
              each scenario are not well understood. Here, we study the
              architecture of adaptation of a binary polygenic trait (such as
              resistance) with negative epistasis among the loci of its basis.
              The genetic structure of this trait allows for a full range of
              potential architectures of adaptation, ranging from sweeps to
              small frequency shifts. By combining computer simulations and a
              newly devised analytical framework based on Yule branching
              processes, we gain a detailed understanding of the adaptation
              dynamics for this trait. Our key analytical result is an
              expression for the joint distribution of mutant alleles at the
              end of the adaptive phase. This distribution characterizes the
              polygenic pattern of adaptation at the underlying genotype when
              phenotypic adaptation has been accomplished. We find that a
              single compound parameter, the population-scaled background
              mutation rate $\Theta$bg, explains the main differences among
              these patterns. For a focal locus, $\Theta$bg measures the
              mutation rate at all redundant loci in its genetic background
              that offer alternative ways for adaptation. For adaptation
              starting from mutation-selection-drift balance, we observe
              different patterns in three parameter regions. Adaptation
              proceeds by sweeps for small $\Theta$bg ≲ 0.1, while small
              polygenic allele frequency shifts require large $\Theta$bg ≳ 100.
              In the large intermediate regime, we observe a heterogeneous
              pattern of partial sweeps at several interacting loci.",

               effect has remained one of the most important gaps in selection
               theory. In the last decade, there have been several efforts to
               attack the problem when many loci are involved using computer
               simulation (Fraser, 1957; Cockerham and Martin, 1958; Gill,
               1965; Qureshi and Kempthorne, 1968, and others). These have
               rather illustrated its importance than increased our fundamental
               understanding. The problem is certainly very complex. In this
               paper we deal initially with a rather simplified situation with
               a set of loci equally spaced along a chromosome, each with two
               alleles with the same initial allelic frequencies and effects on

              standing genetic variation. Genomic data collected over tens of
              generations in both natural and lab populations is increasingly
              used to find selected loci underpinning such rapid adaptation.
              Although selection on large effect loci may be detectable in such
              data, often the fitness differences between individuals have a
              polygenic architecture, such that selection at any one locus
              leads to allele frequency changes that are too subtle to
              distinguish from genetic drift. However, one promising signal
              comes from the fact that selection on polygenic traits leads to
              heritable fitness backgrounds that neutral alleles can become
              stochastically associated with. These associations perturb
              neutral allele frequency trajectories, creating autocovariance
              across generations that can be directly measured from temporal
              genomic data. We develop theory that predicts the magnitude of
              these temporal autocovariances, showing that it is determined by
              the level of additive genetic variation, recombination, and
              linkage disequilibria in a region. Furthermore, by using analytic
              expressions for the temporal variances and autocovariances in
              allele frequency, we demonstrate one can estimate the additive
              genetic variation for fitness and the drift-effective population
              size from temporal genomic data. Finally, we also show how the
              proportion of total variation in allele frequency change due to
              linked selection can be estimated from temporal data. Temporal
              genomic data offers strong opportunities to identify the role

               understand how natural selection influences DNA sequence
               variability. Yet while empirical studies have uncovered
               significant evidence for selection in many natural populations,
               a rigorous characterization of these selection pressures has so
               far been difficult to achieve. The problem is that when
               selection acts on linked loci, it introduces correlations along
               the genome that are difficult to disentangle. These
               ``interference'' effects have been extensively studied in
               simulation, but theory still struggles to account for
               interference in predicted patterns of sequence variability,
               which limits the quantitative conclusions that can be drawn from
               modern sequence data. Here, we show that in spite of this
               complexity, simple behavior emerges in the limit that
               interference is common. Patterns of molecular evolution depend
               on the variance in fitness within the population, and are only
               weakly influenced by the fitness effects of individual
               mutations. We leverage this ``emergent simplicity'' to establish
               a new framework for predicting genetic diversity in these
               populations. Our results have important practical implications
               for the interpretation of natural sequence variability,
               particularly in regions of low recombination, and suggest an

               the multilocus allele frequency differentiation between two
               populations. We use Brownian motion to model genetic drift under
               neutrality, and a deterministic model to approximate the effect

               model of a random-mating population of constant size. These are
               features expected after a recent selective sweep. Their
               prevalence suggests that positive directional selection may be
               widespread in both species. However, as I show here, these
               features do not persist long after the sweep ends: The
               high-frequency alleles drift to fixation and no longer
               contribute to polymorphism, while linkage disequilibrium is

               alleles result from resampling of finite populations (genetic
               drift) and the random genetic background of nearby selected
               alleles on which the neutral alleles are found (linked
               selection). There is now good evidence that linked selection
               plays an important role in shaping polymorphism levels in a
               number of species. One of the best-investigated models of linked
               selection is the recurrent full-sweep model, in which newly
               arisen selected alleles fix rapidly. However, the bulk of
               selected alleles that sweep into the population may not be
               destined for rapid fixation. Here we develop a general model of
               recurrent selective sweeps in a coalescent framework, one that
               generalizes the recurrent full-sweep model to the case where
               selected alleles do not sweep to fixation. We show that in a
               large population, only the initial rapid increase of a selected
               allele affects the genealogy at partially linked sites, which
               under fairly general assumptions are unaffected by the
               subsequent fate of the selected allele. We also apply the theory
               to a simple model to investigate the impact of recurrent partial
               sweeps on levels of neutral diversity and find that for a given
               reduction in diversity, the impact of recurrent partial sweeps
               on the frequency spectrum at neutral sites is determined
               primarily by the frequencies rapidly achieved by the selected
               alleles. Consequently, recurrent sweeps of selected alleles to
               low frequencies can have a profound effect on levels of
               diversity but can leave the frequency spectrum relatively
               unperturbed. In fact, the limiting coalescent model under a high
               rate of sweeps to low frequency is identical to the standard
               neutral model. The general model of selective sweeps we describe
               goes some way toward providing a more flexible framework to

               genetics is the profound effect that natural selection on one
               locus can have on genetic variation patterns at linked loci.
               Since the first evidence for linked selection was uncovered in
               Drosophila melanogaster over two decades ago, substantial effort
               has focused on quantifying the effects and on distinguishing the
               relative contributions of purifying and positive selection. We
               introduce an approach to jointly model the effects of positive
               and negative selection along the genome and infer selection
               parameters. To this end, we consider how closely linked each
               neutral site is to different types of annotations and
               substitutions. When we apply the inference method to genome-wide
               data from 125 D. melanogaster lines, our model explains most of
               the variance in diversity levels at the megabase scale and
               allows us to distinguish among the contribution of different
               modes of selection on proteins and UTRs. More generally, we
               provide a map of the effects of natural selection along the

               melanogaster populations evolving to a new hot temperature
               environment for almost 70 generations. In the first analysis, we
               sequenced 58 haploid genomes from the founder population and
               evolved flies at generation 67. We show that during the
               experiment linkage disequilibrium (LD) increased almost
               uniformly over much greater distances than typically seen in
               Drosophila. In the second analysis, Pool-Seq time series data of
               the three replicates were combined with haplotype information
               from the founder population to follow blocks of initial
               haplotypes over time. We identified 17 selected haplotype-blocks
               that started at low frequencies in the base population and
               increased in frequency during the experiment. The size of these
               haplotype-blocks ranged from 0.082 to 4.01 Mb. Moreover, between
               42\% and 46\% of the top candidate single nucleotide
               polymorphisms from the comparison of founder and evolved
               populations fell into the genomic region covered by the
               haplotype-blocks. We conclude that LD in such rising
               haplotype-blocks results in long range hitchhiking over multiple
               kilobase-sized regions. LD in such haplotype-blocks is therefore
               a major factor contributing to an excess of candidate loci.
               Although modifications of the experimental design may help to
               reduce the hitchhiking effect and allow for more precise mapping
               of causative variants, we also note that such haplotype-blocks
               might be well suited to study the dynamics of selected genomic
               regions during experimental evolution studies.",

               the dynamics of rapid adaptation are not well understood. Here a
               population genetic model of polygenic selection is analyzed to
               describe the short-term response of a quantitative trait after a
               sudden shift of the phenotypic optimum. We provide explicit
               analytical expressions for the time scales over which the trait

               frequency changes that occur in the short-term phase in a

               dramatic changes in the allele frequency may occur provided the

               The framework is also extended to allow for other deterministic

               recursions that fully describe the state of the population are

  abstract  = "ABSTRACT The sampling distributions of several statistics that
               measure the association of alleles on gametes (linkage
               disequilibrium) are estimated under a two-locus neutral infinite
               allele model using an efficient Monte Carlo method. An often
               used approximation for the mean squared linkage disequilibrium
               is shown to be inaccurate unless the proper statistical
               conditioning is used. The joint distribution of linkage
               disequilibrium and the allele frequencies in the sample is
               studied. This estimated joint distribution is sufficient for
               obtaining an approximate maximum likelihood estimate of C = 4Nc,
               where N is the population size and c is the recombination rate.
               It has been suggested that observations of high linkage
               disequilibrium might be a good basis for rejecting a neutral
               model in favor of a model in which natural selection maintains
               genetic variation. It is found that a single sample of
               chromosomes, examined at two loci cannot provide sufficient
               information for such a test if C C this small, very high levels
               of linkage disequilibrium are not unexpected under the neutral
               model. In samples of size 50, it is found that, even when C is
               as large as 50, the distribution of linkage disequilibrium
               conditional on the allele frequencies is substantially different
               from the distribution when there is no linkage between the loci.
               When conditioned on the number of alleles at each locus in the
               sample, all of the sample statistics examined are nearly
               independent of $\lambda$ = 4N$\mu$, where $\mu$ is the neutral

               treatments of this method have adopted rather limiting

               is generally applicable to a wide variety of organisms. Use of a

               possibility of partial full-sib mating and other systems such as
               assortative mating. The general equation for the case of equal
               number of sexes and constant number of breeding individuals (N)
               is Ne = 4N/[2(1 - alpha I) + (Sk2 + 4Q2C2) (1 + alpha I + 2
               alpha O)], where Sk2 is the variance of family size due to
               sampling without selection, C2 is the variance of selective
               advantages among families (the squared coefficient of variation
               of the expected number of offspring per family), alpha I is the
               deviation from Hardy-Weinberg proportions, alpha O is the
               correlation between genes of male and female parents, and Q2 is
               the term accounting for the cumulative effect of selection on an
               inherited trait. This is obtained as Q = 2/[2 - G(1 + r)], where
               G is the remaining proportion of genetic variance in selected
               individuals and r is the correlation of the expected selective
               values of male and female parents. The method is also extended
               to the general case of different numbers of male and female
               parents. The predictive value of the formulae is tested under a
               model of truncation selection with the infinitesimal model of
               gene effects, where C2 and G are a function of the selection
               intensity, the heritability and the intraclass correlation of
               sibs. Under random mating r = alpha I = -1/(N - 1) and alpha O =
               0. Under partial full-sib mating with an average proportion beta
               of full-sib matings per generation, r approximately beta and
               alpha O approximately alpha I approximately beta/(4 - 3 beta).
               The prediction equation is compared to other approximations
               based on the long-term contributions of ancestors to
               descendants. Finally, based on the approach followed, a system
               of mating (compensatory mating) is proposed to reduce rates of
               inbreeding without loss of response in selection programs in

               colonies of the moth Panaxia dominula, begun by R. A. Fisher, E.

               their conclusions have been criticized, on the grounds that
               phenotypes have been improperly scored and that population
               structure has been misunderstood. The results are re-examined
               here, including recent unpublished collections. It is argued
               that the colonies studied are distinct populations, as usually
               defined, and that the results could not arise as a result of
               migration. Fluctuation in population size from year to year,
               large variance in fecundity and some features of mating
               behaviour probably reduce the effective number to less than half
               the estimated population size. Variable expressivity and
               consequent subjective variation in scoring, casts some doubt on
               earlier claims that selection fluctuates significantly from
               generation to generation, and on a reported case of increase in
               frequency from a very low starting point. However, the one
               natural and three artificial colonies studied are consistent in
               providing estimates of selection of 7 per cent or more against
               medionigra, despite the variation introduced by small population
               size and scoring difficulties. There appears to be an
               equilibrium at a low frequency, and the rate of approach to it
               suggests that the selection is frequency dependent. One
               artificial colony, at West Kirby on the Wirral, Merseyside,
               U.K., does not show an equivalent decline. Selection cannot be
               as strong as indicated elsewhere, but since the population size
               is small some disadvantage to medionigra cannot be rejected.",

               article reviews the theory of such genetic hitchhiking,
               concentrating on effects on neutral loci. Maynard Smith and
               Haigh introduced the classical case where the perturbation is
               due to a single favourable mutation. This is contrasted with the
               apparently distinct effects of inherited variation in fitness
               due to loosely linked loci. A model of fluctuating selection is
               analysed which bridges these alternative treatments. When
               alleles sweep between extreme frequencies at a rate lambda, the
               rate of drift is increased by a factor (1 +
               E[1/pq]lambda/(2(2lambda + r))), where the recombination rate r

               weaker, and only cause a local increase in the frequency of a
               neutral allele. This increase depends primarily on the rate of
               recombination relative to selection (r/s), and more weakly, on
               the neighbourhood size, Nb = 4(pi rho sigma)2. Spatial
               subdivision may allow local selective sweeps to occur more
               frequently than is indicated by the overall rate of molecular
               evolution. However, it seems unlikely that such sweeps can be

  title     = "Genetic and statistical analyses of strong selection on
               polygenic traits: what, me normal?",
  author    = "Turelli, M and Barton, N H",
  abstract  = "We develop a general population genetic framework for analyzing
               selection on many loci, and apply it to strong truncation and
               disruptive selection on an additive polygenic trait. We first
               present statistical methods for analyzing the infinitesimal
               model, in which offspring breeding values are normally
               distributed around the mean of the parents, with fixed variance.
               These show that the usual assumption of a Gaussian distribution
               of breeding values in the population gives remarkably accurate
               predictions for the mean and the variance, even when disruptive
               selection generates substantial deviations from normality. We
               then set out a general genetic analysis of selection and
               recombination. The population is represented by multilocus
               cumulants describing the distribution of haploid genotypes, and
               selection is described by the relation between mean fitness and
               these cumulants. We provide exact recursions in terms of
               generating functions for the effects of selection on non-central
               moments. The effects of recombination are simply calculated as a
               weighted sum over all the permutations produced by meiosis.
               Finally, the new cumulants that describe the next generation are
               computed from the non-central moments. Although this scheme is
               applied here in detail only to selection on an additive trait,
               it is quite general. For arbitrary epistasis and linkage, we
               describe a consistent infinitesimal limit in which the
               short-term selection response is dominated by infinitesimal
               allele frequency changes and linkage disequilibria. Numerical
               multilocus results show that the standard Gaussian approximation
               gives accurate predictions for the dynamics of the mean and
               genetic variance in this limit. Even with intense truncation
               selection, linkage disequilibria of order three and higher never
               cause much deviation from normality. Thus, the empirical
               deviations frequently found between predicted and observed
               responses to artificial selection are not caused by
               linkage-disequilibrium-induced departures from normality.
               Disruptive selection can generate substantial four-way
               disequilibria, and hence kurtosis; but even then, the Gaussian
               assumption predicts the variance accurately. In contrast to the
               apparent simplicity of the infinitesimal limit, data suggest
               that changes in genetic variance after 10 or more generations of
               selection are likely to be dominated by allele frequency
               dynamics that depend on genetic details.",

  abstract  = "The statistical properties of the standardized variance of gene
               frequency changes (a quantity equivalent to Wright's inbreeding
               coefficient) in a random mating population are studied, and new
               formulae for estimating the effective population size are
               developed. The accuracy of the formulae depends on the ratio of
               sample size to effective size, the number of generations
               involved ( t ), and the number of loci or alleles used. It is
               shown that the standardized variance approximately follows the
               $X$2 distribution unless t is very large, and the confidence
               interval of the estimate of effective size can be obtained by
               using this property. Application of the formulae to data from an
               isolated population of Dacus oleae has shown that the effective
               size of this population is about one tenth of the minimum census
               size, though there was a possibility that the procedure of
               sampling genes was improper.",
